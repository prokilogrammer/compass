    "desc": "\n                    Marten Creek Trail is an oft-overlooked route in summer months that is virtually forgotten come winter. That is a blessing to those who know of, and take advantage of, the beauty of this secluded little forest valley. The crowds skip over this trail because there are no high, windswept ridges to explore and no deep alpine lake basins in which to camp. But there is a narrow, winding trail that is loads of fun to follow on snowshoes, a rich forest ecosystem to explore, and a host of wildlife to view and appreciate. (In low-snow years, it may be necessary to carry the snowshoes on the lower section of trail, but the upper valley is generally deep in snow by mid-December.)<br><br>The trail climbs steadily from the highway, staying well above the creek itself for the first mile. The views are limited to the local forest scenery, but that is rich enough to hold anyone&apos;s attention. Of course, there&apos;s not a lot of time for gawking, as this narrow, under-maintained trail is rough and, with a blanket of snow on it, avoiding snowshoe-tearing branches and toe-grabbing logs requires undivided attention at times. <br><br>At other times, however, the trail is open and easily followed. These stretches--especially past the 1-mile mark--are where the views can be best appreciated. After the initial 1.5 miles, the trail stops climbing and rolls into a long traverse of the ridge wall above the creek, dipping at times to water level before angling back up into the open forest above. Around 2.5 miles, the trail angles left toward the head of the valley. It continues another 0.8 mile before the formal trail peters out.<br><br>It&apos;s possible, when the snow is stable, to continue up the valley for another 0.5 mile to get right under the shadow of the near-vertical headwall. Just don&apos;t get too close, as avalanches aren&apos;t the only danger here. Rockfalls are much more common than snowslides, and just as deadly. If the weather is warming, or the avalanche danger is moderate or great, don&apos;t push past the end of the formal trail.<br><br>Because the creek valley is relatively wide-bottomed with plenty of lush undergrowth for forage, it&apos;s common for deer to be found in this area. And where there are deer, there are cougars. Count yourself lucky if you see one of these big, elusive cats. Usually the only proof that mountain lions exist in these woods comes in the form of deep, clawless tracks pressed into the snow.<br><br>Big animals aren&apos;t the only inhabitants here. Grouse roost in the trees near the creek, snowshoe hares scamper through the underbrush along the trail, and at least one great horned owl glides silently between the trees looking for a midwinter meal of rabbit, vole, or marten. Yes, the creek is aptly named - martens have also been seen along this pretty trail.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Backcountry<br>These routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses. These routes require complete competence in winter survival skills, avalanche and snow condition evaluation and some basic mountaineering skills.\n                 ",

Cross the river, taking a right (at the unmaintained trail to Canada) and follow the river upstream.

Take advantage of this one, and don&apos;t expect many (if any) water sources for the next seven miles after. Snowy Top Mountain (7572 feet) will lure scramblers, while those who opt to stay on trail will delight in the views that the Shedroof Divide has to offer in this section.

About 1.5 miles after reaching the divide, you&apos;ll pass a one mile spur trail to the Little Snowy Top Lookout, which is open to the public.

Two sparkling alpine lakes, an abundance of wildflowers, an impressive mountainous backdrop and a year-round snowfield make this a hike that will please everybody. What&apos;s more, this trail gets a fraction of the foot traffic that the trails at Artist Point get in late summer.<br><br>Bagley Lakes can be done in a loop, though families with very small children might opt to go out and back. Start at the large parking lot signed for Bagley Lakes and the Wild Goose trails. Just past the trailhead, take a right turn and head down about 60 feet to Lower Bagley Lake at the foot of Mt. Herman. At the lake, choose the left fork (signed Bagley Lakes Loop), and hike along the trail that runs along the east side of the lake.<br><br>The way is easy for little feet, and children will delight in the wildflowers along the trail. As you reach the upper end of the lake, the source turns into a burbling creek for the next quarter mile as the views of Table Mountain and the cirque below it open up. At Upper Bagley Lake, cross over the creek on an arching stone bridge and walk along its northwest shore. There are places to dip toes into the freezing water or to simply contemplate the majesty of the area.<br><br>A good destination for a short outing is the year-round snowfield at the upper part of the lake. To get there requires some sure-footedness around a stone wall. Kids can throw a snowball or two and everyone can admire the braided waterway as it runs down to form the lake. Do make sure that no one plays on top of the snow bridge above the creek; it could break.<br><br>To return, go back to the stone bridge. To complete the loop, choose the Chain Lakes trail that runs along the opposite side of Lower Bagley Lake. That way is a bit harder than the trail on the way in, crossing some rocks and seasonal streams - but it is still quite easy for most kids over four. This trail will cross the output of the lake on a little dam. Take a left after the dam and return up to the parking lot.</p>\n                 ",

Mounts Baker and Shuksan breathe their frosty breaths upon you. A choppy sea of jagged peaks from British Columbia to the Picket Range washes up upon your boots. Gaze out to salty waters or deep into the heart of the North Cascades wilderness. And best of all, you wont&apos; be competing for space on the summit. The crowds are over at nearby Hannegan Peak. <br><br>Starting in thick forest decorated with mossy boulders, the way immediately winds upward. On excellent tread the grade is mostly moderate - but trust me, it&apos;ll get steeper. Much of Goat Mountain succumbed to fire nearly a half century ago, and blackened snags bear witness to the past conflagration.<br><br>At about 1.75 miles enter the Mount Baker Wilderness. Shortly afterward pass an unmarked side trail (elev. 3900 ft) that heads right. It leads 0.5 mile to an old lookout site. The view is good, but the ones waiting for you along the main trail are better. Far better. So continue climbing. Thick forest cover soon thins, replaced by a jungle of mountain ash, maple, alder and willow. Then the surrounding walls of shrubbery begin to dissipate, yielding to low-lying blueberry bushes and expanding views.<br><br>At about 3.75 miles arrive on a 5100 foot knoll with a knockout view of glacier-harboring Mount Sefrit and Shuksan. From the good early turnaround option (or early season objective), you&apos;ll also find an excellent shot of glistening Price Lake tucked in a high cirque on Shuksan&apos;s northern face of ice and rock.<br><br>The trail continues along the spine of a ridge, officially terminating at 5600 feet at the base of expansive meadows high on Goat&apos;s south-facing slopes. From here follow a rough but well-defined route, first across, then straight up those flower-studded steep slopes. Cross a couple of spring-fed creeks adorned with showy bouquets. The way here is prone to slumping, so travel carefully. After a long traverse the trail insanely heads straight up the verdant slope, reaching a 6250-foot shoulder and an amazing view north to Tomyhoi, the High Divide, and British Columbia&apos;s infinite summits.<br><br>Now turn right and follow a ridgeline course, reaching a 6650-foot high point after 0.5 mile of some of the most incredible alpine viewing in the North Cascades. Look at all those peaks: Redoubt, Jack, Ruth, Blum, Triumph and Whitehorse among them, and Slesse, Rexford and Silver Tip among their Canadian cousins.<br><br>Don&apos;t forget to admire your immediate surroundings too, like the small glacier directly below wedged between Goat&apos;s two prominent summits. And speaking of summits, the peak&apos;s actual high point is just to the north of you. Only 100 feet higher, it requires crossing a dangerous snowfield and scrambling exposed rock.

The wide track, with plenty of open meadows and forest glades for exploring, offers great snow&#xAC;shoeing for folks of all abilities. The scenery will, likewise, appeal to all. The views begin with the glorious winter landscape around the trail--picture dark, shadowy evergreens flocked with heavy white snow set beside a clear mountain river--but soon all eyes are drawn to the vista beyond. This is a narrow valley, and the mountains flanking it soar straight up into the sky. From Goat Mountain to Mount Sefrit and the Nooksack Ridge, the peaks form a ragged skyline far above the valley floor.<br><br>When venturing out this way, be sure to call the district ranger first to get a current snow report. This is a fairly low-elevation trail, and although some years 3 or 4 feet of snow may be along the trail, mild winters can find the track snow-free for much of its length. Of course, one of the conveniences of snowshoes is that regular hiking boots can be worn when walking on them. That means, when the snow is thin, just stash the snowshoes and take a winter hike.<br><br>From the Sno-Park, you can simply ramble out into the open glades along the Nooksack River, but to get in a full day of snowshoeing, head out along Forest Road 3070 as it parallels the picturesque river upstream. As you hike up the valley, be sure to stay off the groomed ski tracks. Volunteers groom this trail for cross-country skiers, and there is no faster way to irritate skiers than by tromping their tracks into a series of deep snowshoe depressions. But plenty of room is available for all, and in several areas you can take off through open meadows to get well clear of the ski tracks and be off on your own.<br><br>Angle off to the left in the first mile or so to get down to the river for some water views. But stay back from the edge because weak snow may be overhanging the water. As you move up the valley, veer to the right to climb onto the foot of the valley wall and enter the dark cedar and hemlock forest. At 2 miles, turn sharply to the right (south) and climb a small bench for good, open views of Goat Mountain to the north.<br><br>Then traverse around the lower edge of the bench and enter the White Salmon Creek basin. Pick a path through the trees to the edge of the creek. For an extended outing, push on upstream and continue until the trees get too tight or your legs get too tired. To keep the trek modest, turn downstream and follow the White Salmon for 0.25 mile back to the main track, which ends where the White Salmon empties into the Nooksack.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Easiest. <br>Generally good trails for beginners, with little elevation change and minimal avalanche danger.\n                 ",

If you can snag it, try getting a reservation for Graybeal Camp, 2.1 miles in from the Brush Creek Trail junction. Note that in late summer, Graybeal Camp is dry, so you&apos;ll have to get water from Brush Creek where the trail drops close to it a half mile before the camp.<br><br>Beyond the Brush Creek junction, 22.6 miles from the trailhead, bypass the horse ford to get to the cable car crossing. At 22.9 miles, pull yourself across the Chilliwack in a small 2-seater cable car. The pull rope is rough and requires some strength; gloves are advised.<br><br>After the cable car crossing, climb gently past U.S. Cabin Camp at 23.6 miles, then to Copper Creek Camps at 26.1.

Showy penstemon and monkey flowers spruce up the stark gulch with touches of purple and gold.<br><br>Climb more steeply, now, rounding Yellow Aster&apos;s south shoulder. Catch your breath-not from altitude, but from multitude-a beautiful multitude of peaks, ridges, and tarns spread out before you. At 3.5 miles reach a junction on a ledge overlooking the glacier-scoured tarnished plateau below. Head left, dropping about 200 feet to explore this water-pocked pocket; or take the way trail right, steeply climbing 400 feet in 0.25 mile to ascend the butte.<br><br>From this 6150-foot promontory, look out over an amazing landscape of emerald ridges, verdant valleys, snow-capped spires, and glacier-clad giants.

Several rusty mining relics can be found near the trail. <br><br>When you reach Apex Pass a few miles farther, you&#x2019;re presented with your first views of craggy Cathedral Peak, unlike anything else in the Pasayten. At 26 miles you&#x2019;ll reach 7,600-ft Cathedral Pass, then head down to upper Cathedral Lake near the base of the impressive 8,360-foot Amphitheater Mountain. Camping is good here, and you&#x2019;ll want time to savor the ambiance. <br><br>If you&#x2019;ve built in a layover day, or have a few hours to spare, consider the extra few miles for the unmarked trail up the south side of Amphitheater Mountain. This horse trail goes nearly to the top and the views include most of the Pasayten Wilderness. <br><br>Leaving the Cathedral Lakes behind, the views continue as you hike west, with bulky 8,685-foot Remmel Mountain being front and center. This is followed by a long descent to the log crossing over the Ashnola River at 38 miles. Across the river is a 2,000 foot climb to more big meadows near 6,900-foot Peeve Pass at 42 miles. <br><br>Following the pass, trail conditions begin to deteriorate before it climbs right over the top of 7,240-foot Bunker Hill. Stop for lunch here before descending a bit more than 3,000 feet to the Pasayten River. Ford the river&#x2014;a detour downstream may be necessary&#x2014;then hike upstream for 7 miles to the site of the old Three Forks Cabin. Here is a pivotal trail junction where three streams of the Pasayten come together.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges of hiking the entire 80-plus-mile Boundary Trail is where to exit. The &#x201C;official&#x201D; ending descends to Ross Lake via the Castle Pass and Lightning Creek trails. However, this section receives little maintenance and is not recommended. <br><br>From Three Forks Junction, one option heads south up the Middle Fork Pasayten Trail to exit via Slate Pass. Hiking out via the West Fork Pasayten Trail exits near Slate Peak. Two other options provide access to the Pacific Crest Trail via either Woody Pass or Holman Pass. From Holman Pass, longer options exist to hike over Devils Dome to Ross Lake or McMillan Park to Hwy 20.<br><br>Hiking out via the mostly forested Middle Fork Pasayten River is the shortest way out to the Slate Pass trailhead (Harts Pass area, 80 hiking miles from Irongate).<br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: If you like to get off the trail and scramble easy summits, the Boundary Trail was made for you. At 8,100 feet, Armstrong Mountain is a long mile from Horseshoe Basin and takes you right to U.S.&#x2013;Canadian border. Haig Mountain is higher, but Teapot Dome at 7,610 feet is just a half-mile from the Boundary Trail. 8,300 foot-high Apex Mountain is almost mandatory, given the legendary views of Cathedral Peak. From the 7,100-foot pass, Bald Mountain looms 7,930 feet high over the Ashnola River, and Sheep Mountain, at 8,275 feet, near Peeve Pass will each take at least a few hours of your time.</p>\n                 ",

Over the years, Shuksan&#x2019;s gentle nature won the heart of Kulshan and drove Tahoma to jealous rage. She moved south, but finding herself separated from her family, she grew taller and taller in order to keep Kulshan within sight.<br><br>Kulshan, or Koma Kulshan, meaning &#x201C;snow-capped mountain with a wound at the tip&#x201D; in Lummi, or &#x201C;hunting place in the mountains&#x201D; in Nooksack, was named Mount Baker by George Vancouver in honor of his third-in-command in 1792. Thanks to Forest Service roads and the Skyline Divide trail, you can personally witness the beauty that drove Tahoma to jealous eruptions. The Skyline Divide is a 6000-foot-high northward extension of Koma Kulshan that transforms itself into a summertime paradise of unrivaled mountain views and unending wildflower fields.<br><br>The hike starts at a well-marked trailhead kiosk. Bring water with you, as there are no sources on the trail once snows have melted. Sunscreen is advisable, too, as the way is somewhat exposed. The trail gains 1500 feet in two miles to reach the ridgeline, so the grade is moderately steep as you ascend through a forest of western hemlock, mountain hemlock, and silver fir. Foamflower blooms in the summer, and huckleberries ripen late in the hiking season. Loving trailwork from the WTA has led to steps and turnpikes that allow this trail to withstand up to 5000 pairs of boots each year. When you approach the timberline (elevation 5900 feet), fields of wildflowers bloom and views of Kulshan peek through the trees, but you ain&apos;t seen nothin&#x2019; yet!<br><br>Burst out onto a knoll on the ridgeline, with Kulshan confronting you to the south. Kulshan&#x2019;s second wife, the non-volcanic Shuksan, is to the east, and the High Divide is to the north. The trail forks left, leading to potential campsites. Continue right and pass into the Mount Baker Wilderness. The hike continues 2.5 more miles on the gently rolling ridgeline over a series of five more knolls. At the second knoll, there is a fork. The path to the left takes you higher on a more difficult track, whereas the path to the right has more stable footing. At the third knoll, you face a similar left versus right decision. Regardless of your choice, the views are panoramic, and the flowers are ubiquitous. As you move southward, the views only get better as Kulshan looms larger and larger over the horizon. A partial list of the flowers that bloom on this part of the ridge includes aster, fireweed, arnica, oxeye daisy, lupine, valerian, bistort, glacier lily, and cow parsnip.<br><br>At the fourth knoll, 3.5 miles from the trailhead (6000 feet elevation), cairns mark a key fork. The trail to the left goes to campsites one mile away near Deadhorse Creek in the valley between the Skyline and Cougar Divides. If you turn right, you will ascend the spines of the fifth and sixth knolls. The farther you go, the more likely you are to meet chipmunks and grouse. The flower population changes as the terrain becomes more rocky and wind-exposed. Look for St. John&#x2019;s wort, monkeyflower, harebells, heather, phlox, campion, paintbrush, silky phacelia, and penstemon. How many hiking guide entries need two flower lists?<br><br>As you summit the sixth knoll, you will reach 6,563 feet of elevation. Kulshan is just 3.5 miles from you. In front of you is Chowder Ridge, a trail best reserved for those with either hooves or the proper equipment for scrambling, snow, and ice. To the east are Yellow Aster Butte and Shuksan, and the North Cascades are in the distance. To your south are the Black Buttes (Lincoln and Colfax Peaks), the remnants of the local volcano that preceded Kulshan, and Twin Sisters Mountain. After you soak in the views, pull yourself away, if you can.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Many choose to camp and include the night sky among the incredible views found at Skyline Divide. Potential sites include the first knoll (left turn after achieving the ridgeline) or the Deadhorse Creek campground area mentioned above. An information-gathering stop at the Glacier Public Service Center is also a nice addition.</p>\n                 ",

Now enjoy a near-level mile across Table&apos;s open southern slopes, admiring the snowy ridge before you and the verdant Swift Creek and Rainbow valleys below you.<br><br>At 1.2 miles reach a junction (elev. 5200 ft). The Chain Lakes Trail diverges right, along with most of the folks trailing behind you. Now off into the tundra you go, straight ahead. Drop a little, skirting beneath a snow-draped 5600-foot knoll. Soon the way heads upward again, and chances are good it&apos;ll be on fairly steep snowfields. Crest the ridgeline and continue on your way toward the North Cascades&apos; mightiest peak. Scan the slopes below for mountain goats. Carefully inspect the wind-blasted, frost-burned ridge for its namesake, ptarmigans-chickenlike birds that live in the alpine tundra. They spend most of their lives on the ground foraging on buds, berries, and seeds.<br><br>Continue across rock, snow, the occasional meadow, every step taking you closer to the 10,778-foot volcano. Climbing higher, round a 5800-foot knoll. A mile farther, round the prominent 6414-foot Coleman Pinnacle. A popular scrambling destination, no need to go all the way to the top for good views-you&apos;ve already got them!<br><br>At about 5 miles from the trailhead arrive at a flat known as Camp Kiser that sports hemlocks and colorful tents. This is the turnaround for most day hikers. Admire Rain-bow Glacier in all its crevassed beauty right before you. Turn your attention southward down into a lonely basin to a beautiful sparkling tarn, just recently revealed to the world.\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Artist Point is the top competitor for best viewpoint in the state. The beautifully shaped Mount Shuksan is the star of the area, with a gorgeous summit pyramid and several impressive glaciers. Mount Baker dominates the skyline in the southwest. Artist Point also is a great viewpoint for the Cascades, with sweeping views of the valley of Baker Lake and in the far distance peaks like Whitehorse Mountain, Three Fingers, Sloan Peak and White Chuck Mountain. Immediately from the trailhead beautiful peaks in the north are visible, such as American Border Peak, Mount Larrabee, and Goat Mountain.<br><br>Artist Point is an excellent winter destination. The area typically gets large amounts of snow: it even holds the world record amount of snowfall within a season (95 feet). Due to its northern location and a trailhead at 4200 feet, good snow coverage is virtually guaranteed from November to June. In average years, cars can drive all the way to the Artist Point parking area from July until late September, but the remainder of the year the Mount Baker Highway is only plowed to the ski area at Heather Meadows (Picture Lake). In extreme years like 1999, the last section to Artist Point might not open at all. The ski area is small and isolated enough that it does not disturb the peace and quiet at Artist Point, and helps with winter access to this beautiful place.<br><br>Artist Point is a 4-mile roundtrip snowshoe with about 1000 feet of elevation gain. It is a popular destination, so there is almost always a clearly visible track to follow. Artist Point should be doable for most beginning snowshoers, but there are a couple of steeper (though not exposed) sections that can be challenging depending on the snow conditions. If you venture out with fog or snow in the forecast, then be cautious that route finding skills are critical in this open terrain.<br><br>The route to Artist Point does go through avalanche terrain, so this trip is not without danger. Depending on the specific risks, it is best to avoid the area when avalanche risk is considerable. Please carefully consider the NWAC avalanche forecast before venturing out (updated every night at 6pm). By carefully picking your route the steepest terrain and the more dangerous avalanche slopes can be avoided, but this requires experience with route finding and snow conditions. <br><br>The trailhead to Artist Point is at the last parking area on the Mount Baker Highway. No permits nor payment are required. The arrival at Heather Meadows can be a bit confusing due to all the activity at the ski area. Upon arrival at Heather Meadows, continue to drive around Picture Lake (one-way) and past the ski lifts. The large parking area is on the right at the end of the road. The trail begins left of the bathroom facilities. <br><br>Initially there are typically various tracks in the open, relatively flat terrain outside of the ski area. Depending on the route that you choose, after half a mile there are a few large cabins. At this point, head more uphill to the Austin Pass. During this climb (which gets a bit steeper), there is only a single track, which follows exactly the ski area boundary, which is clearly marked (do not enter the ski area). During this first section of the trip, there is no view of Mount Baker nor Mount Shuksan. Both are hiding behind various arms, but there are already gorgeous views to border with Canada and on the north-face of Table Mountain. Note that you should not follow the road to the Austin Pass. This road is in the ski area, and even if the ski area is not yet open, it is steep terrain with avalanche risk.<br><br>From Austin Pass, head southwest towards Artist Point. Again, there are many ways to get there. The direct route that avoids losing elevation is a bit steep. It is a rewarding trip to descend a bit into the wide open terrain, just below the summer road (which is usually not recognizable). The final climb to Artist Point is a bit steeper again, and flattens out into a beautiful slightly hilly area, which is where the summer parking area is hiding. With average snow levels, the outhouse of the Artist Point summer parking area is usually not visible at all, but it is fun to try to find it.<br><br>Mount Baker has been a tease so far: only now does it become visible, with the Ptarmigan Ridge leading to Baker from Table Mountain. Mount Shuksan to the northeast has two large arms, the Shuksan Arm to the west, and an arm to Mount Ann to the south. The Mount Ann arm obscures the views to the North Cascades, but the views on the Central Cascades are rewarding. In the valley to the south, parts of Baker Lake are visible.<br><br>From Artist Point a short side-trip of 1.5 miles roundtrip to Huntoon Point is a great way of taking in more of the scenery. This point is the natural eastern turnaround point on the Kulshan Ridge, which Artist Point is a part of as well.<br><br>It also possible to considerably extend your trip to eight miles by circumnavigating Table Mountain via the Chain Lakes (Iceberg Lake, Mazama Lake), but be extremely cautious about the south-facing slope of Table Mountain. This slope is very avalanche-prone and should be avoided if there is any risk of avalanches. A short side-trip to Bagley Lakes at the trailhead is another way to extend your trip, but be aware that this area is more exposed to avalanche risk as well.<br><br>On the drive back home it is worth stopping at the Nooksack Falls, which is a short walk only, and usually has a nice volume of water.</p>\n                 ",

Soon encounter the first of two challenging (potentially dangerous) crossings of braided Heliotrope Creek. Plan on getting your feet wet in icy-cold, rapidly moving waters. Be aware, too, that if it&apos;s a hot day your return will be even more difficult because of melting snows from above.<br><br>Once safely across, proceed through marmot-enhanced meadows to the hemlock-lined edge of Coleman&apos;s lateral moraine. Wow! Right below you, snaked out like an oversized ice-cream cone on its side, a massive glacier! Continue on scant path, climbing alongside the glacier up the moraine-using care and staying away from the edge-to a 5550-foot ledgy knoll.<br><br>Sit here in awe, gazing at the icy intricacies of the glacier.

This is a largely untouched winter wilderness setting, and finding solitude amid such staggering beauty is remarkable. The trail follows the Middle Fork Nooksack River upstream in the very shadow of majestic Mount Baker. When tired of viewing that big volcano, glance right and soak in the beauty of Loomis Mountain. <br><br>On the return trip, Mount Baker is at your back, but the twin towers of Sisters Mountain loom ahead. In the midst of all this mountain scenery live an array of wild creatures for snowshoers to quietly observe. Snowshoe hares, ptarmigans--large grouselike birds that turn snowy white come winter--martens, weasels, foxes, and blacktail deer thrive in this valley. Of course, with all those prey-animals living here, predators are close at hand. Bobcats, lynx (one of the last population of lynx in Washington), cougars, coyotes, and possibly even wolves roam these woods. These critters pose little danger to healthy, adult humans, and any encounter with them should be counted as a blessing.<br><br>Most years, the snow is at or below the Elbow Lake trailhead parking area. From the Elbow Lake trailhead, hike the 1.5 miles up FR 38 to the Middle Fork Nooksack trailhead. Relax and enjoy the scenery along this road, which is nearly level and well graded. Mount Baker dominates the northeast horizon, and the wide bed of the Middle Fork Nooksack River is a constant source of entertainment to your right. The river weaves in and out of gravel bars and small forested islands, and the snow-lined banks provide a crisp edge to the tumbling waters of the river.<br><br>At the first hairpin turn in the road, go straight to find the trail at the point of the switchback. The trail continues to follow the river upstream, while the road climbs the hill away from the river. The trail is narrow, and if the snow isn&apos;t deep, there may be a few downed trees to scramble over. This trail is seldom maintained, and fallen trees are nearly always present. However, the trees are more a hindrance to skiers than snowshoers, and they help to ensure solitude on this beautiful trail.<br><br>The next 1 mile of trail parallels the river, and the views remain largely unchanged: where the forest is open, Mount Baker, Loomis Mountain, and Park Butte dominate the skyline; where the forest canopy closes in, the beautiful old-growth forest and sparkling river will captivate you.<br><br>At about 3 miles (3200 feet), the trail begins to climb toward Mazama Park on the southwest flank of Mount Baker. The trail, though, is difficult to follow as it traverses several avalanche slopes and dips into areas of dense forest. Better to just enjoy the views, and turn back when the trail turns vertical.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Backcountry<br>These routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses.

Following a fairly open ridgeline graced with clumps of pine, the trail travels under cliffs and over knolls on its way to the summit.<br><br>In 1 mile from the pass, Burch&apos;s summit comes into full view, but you&apos;ll need to work a little harder to get there. The trail drops 200 feet to a larch-filled saddle before ascending the rocky summit cone. Through fields of granite and over alpine tundra, the final grunt to the 7782-foot former lookout site is extremely steep. But this lonely outpost is all yours now! Spin your head around. That&apos;s the Methow Valley and Abernathy Ridge to the south. The Tiffany Highlands, Mount Bonaparte, and the Kettle River Range fill the eastern horizon. To the north lie a plethora of Pasayten peaks. And to the west, staring you right in the face, is Isabella&apos;s intimidating lineup. Savor the scenic splendor and rest up for the return.\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>This hike along Baker Lake is a busy, popular trail in summer. It is a nice off season walk though, and is perfect on a crisp, clear winter day. With the leaves off the trees, views that aren&apos;t possible in summer emerge; the surrounding peaks and the mossy green silhouettes of the leafless maple trees cover the hillside. A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction. <br><br>The hike starts alongside the Baker River on a wide dirt path. Look ahead for a long suspension bridge over the river on your right. In a half mile the trail splits. Straight ahead is the trail up the river; a worthy river wander for another day. Take the right trail and have fun crossing the suspension bridge. The child in all of us should get a little thrill as the bridge bounces with our steps! If the weather is cooperating, you will be able to see some of the nearby snow-capped peaks. Once across, the path heads over an old river channel and crosses Blum creek on the first of many wooden bridges. Climb a little as your path takes you between mossy boulders. Look for spaces in between them, and ponder what small creature would make the caves a winter home. <br><br>Cross another wooden bridge, and you see the river spreading out. Switchback up a short steep section and you will come to Hidden Creek. Just before crossing, there is a very large, recently downed tree. From the jagged stump, with your eyes follow the trunk downhill, you can see it broken in several places. Ponder for a minute, the power of nature that brought such a giant down. <br><br>Hidden Creek is anything but hidden. It is a noisy and wide creek, the white water splashing among the mossy rocks and fallen branches. Here is another cool bridge! This one, built with a long zig zag shape,is also fun to cross, although it must have presented a challenge for the trail crews that engineered it. As you hike above the shoreline, the tip of Mount Baker should come into view above the hillside across the lake. Actually Baker Lake is a reservoir, made when the river was dammed, not the prettiest of lakes when the water is drawn down. In the summer, it is popular with boaters, fishermen, and swimmers. <br><br>Look instead as you hike along the trail, at the beautiful woods, with the green moss hanging off the maple trees and the old man&#x2019;s beard hanging from the fir and hemlock. Enjoy the little streams and more wooden bridges. Remember the newly downed tree seen earlier? Compare that to the old mossy stumps, growing shelf fungus on their sides, the fallen trunks now nurse logs for growing hemlock seedlings. There are some big trees on this trail. Give them a hug, and wonder what it will take to knock them over and start a new cycle. In the spring, look for yellow violets and trillium here also. <br>Come to a wide, unbridged stream, it is shallow and easily crossed on a few well placed rocks. You will see more of Baker, both mountain and lake. It may be tempting here to make your way down to the shore for lunch. Hold off, a better spot awaits you on the other side of the small peninsula you can now see. Head through a small clearing in the trees, here are salmonberry plants growing, and when the magenta flowers open, you may find yourself nose to beak with a Rufus hummingbird.  <br><br>Come to a signed intersection at 4.2 miles. The Baker Lake trail continues straight ahead and crosses Noisy Creek. The left fork heads up alongside Noisy Creek and the right fork leads to Noisy Creek campground. A good place for lunch, there are picnic tables, fire pits and tent sites, plus a backcountry toilet and a metal bear box. Stroll down to the beach for some great views of Mount Baker and maybe the tip of Mount Shuksan. Once lunch is eaten, take the trail up Noisy Creek. You don&#x2019;t have to go far to see &#x2018;Big Doug.&#x2019; This tree has got to be one of the biggest Douglas firs in the Cascades! You will recognize it by the huge gnarled old trunk. Turn around when you are ready to head back to your car, or continue along the main trail as far as you are able to go in a day. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: This trail continues all the way along the east side of the lake, 14.5 miles one way. If you can arrange transportation, try a hike through. There are many trails to explore in the Baker Lake area, car camp at one of the campgrounds along the Baker Lake road and explore them all.</p>\n                 ",

If you do take the fork to the right, you will reach a clear-cut vantage point in 0.1 mile where you can look down upon the entirety of Lost Lake.<br><br>Proceeding left at the above sign, continue north 0.6 miles to a small waterfall, and then the junction with the Rock Trail, on your left. Continue straight ahead; the lake lies 0.6 miles beyond. As you pass red cedars and hemlocks, marvel at old growth, munch on salmonberries if they are out, and stare at the rock walls to your left. When you reach the lake, at 1200 feet of elevation, continue upward again briefly and reach the junction with the north Lost Lake trail. Turn right to double back and find a large rock that offers views of the lake, and explore the waterfall at the outlet. Enjoy your time beside the lake&#x2019;s calm, evergreen-encircled waters.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: the many trails of Larrabee State Park need your help! The rangers do not have adequate staffing to maintain the trails on their own, so consider volunteering for a WTA Work Party to preserve this trail and others so that they may persist into the future.</p>\n                 ",

The park now accounts for a third of the Chuckanut Recreation Area&#x2019;s 8,000 acres of public land. <br><br>The Fragrance Lake trailhead is on Chuckanut Drive, directly across from the main entrance to Larrabee State Park. You&#x2019;ll find a small parking area to the left just past the ranger station, or, if space is available, there are a dozen parking spots on the east side of Chuckanut Drive. A Discover Pass is required in either lot. A pass kiosk, water and flush toilets are available in the park.<br><br>Because the trail sees a lot of boots, it gets a lot of trail maintenance attention from WTA. Apart from one perpetually muddy section, the wide trail does a great job of sloughing off rain. Switchbacks take the bite out of the steeper sections. Many nearby trails allow backpackers, equestrian and mountain bike use, but the trail to Fragrance Lake is restricted to day hikers and (leashed) dogs. There are &#x201C;kissing gates&#x201D; at either end of the trail to help with enforcement. <br><br>After a mile of steady uphill hiking through old-growth forest, arrive at a junction to a short spur trail that ends at an unexpected viewpoint of Samish Bay and the San Juan Islands. Back on the main trail, enjoy a brief downhill stretch before the trail steepens on the way up to the lake. At the next junction, continue left for two tenths of a mile and arrive at Fragrance Lake. Whoever was responsible for the name must have been inspired by the tall trees that completely surround the lake, and the rich scents of bark, pine and soil they provide as the breeze wafts by.<br><br>Shed your pack and have a snack! There&#x2019;s a 0.6-mile loop trail along the shore that provides additional viewpoints and privacy. Rockhounds will love exploring the huge boulders on the west side of the lake. If the weather is good and the body is willing, wade in and cool your feet. Or swim out and join the trout for more frigid exercise. <br><br>Head back the way you came, skipping the spur trail on the return. Strong hikers with map in hand could continue to Lost Lake to add another 5.5 miles and 860 feet of cumulative gain to their day. A car drop or key exchange hike might incorporate the recently constructed Rock Trail. <br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: To replenish calories, pack a picnic lunch to enjoy on the sandy beach or lush lawns at Larrabee State Park. If you&#x2019;re headed back north to Bellingham, it&#x2019;s hard to beat all-day breakfast at the Old Town Cafe. The drive south on Chuckanut Drive passes several spendy seafood options. For lighter fare and more reasonable prices, hold on for the Train Wreck Bar &amp; Grill in Burlington or the Skagit River Brewery in Mount Vernon.</p>\n                 ",

Best of all, this alpine rapture is achieved with minimal effort. The trail starts high and stays high. And with the trail&apos;s gentle ups and down, most hikers young and old, two and four legged will have no problem making the journey.<br><br>Start on a Cat track on the edge of a burn that scorched thousands of acres of high-country forest surrounding Harts Pass. In two minutes reach Trail No. 2000, the Pacific Crest Trail. The trail right heads to Canada. The trail left heads to Mexico via Grasshopper Pass-take it.<br><br>In no time break out of the forest into an open basin punctuated with tall larches. You may notice flagging and other disturbances below. They&apos;re remnants of the Brown Bear Mine. The region is littered with old mines, some still active, but none yielding much these days.<br><br>Gently climb, rounding the open basin, views expanding with each step, and reach a ridge crest at 0.75 mile. The way is all alpine now as the trail skirts steep slopes. Gaze south into the glacially carved South Fork Trout Creek valley. Its U-shaped symmetry indicates past glaciations (V-shaped valleys signify the past work of creeks and rivers).<br><br>At 2 miles (elev. 7000 ft) attain a small gap high on Tatie Peak&apos;s eastern shoulder. Marvel at the array of geological diversity at your feet. Shale, slate, sandstone, and granite-it rocks! Speaking of slate, the peak bearing that name can be seen off to the north. It&apos;s the one with the attractive fire tower gracing its summit.<br><br>Hikers comfortable with off-trail travel may want to continue along the ridge crest for 0.5 mile, climbing 400 feet to Tatie Peak&apos;s 7386-foot summit. It&apos;s not overly difficult; just be aware of the drop-off along the northern slopes. Peak baggers can help themselves to a heaping of visual delights. The prominent summits of Jack, Crater, Azurite, Tower, Robinson, and Ballard can all be sampled from Tatie&apos;s wide open perch.<br><br>The trail, however, forgoes those views, traversing Tatie&apos;s southern slopes to gently descend to another gap (elev. 6800 ft). Squeaky ground squirrels and whistling marmots will accompany you. Sneak a peek at the gap to impressive Mount Ballard and below to Slate Creek, where the mining community of Chancellor once bustled.<br><br>From this point, the trail continues to descend, now through alpine rock gardens and a majestic stand of larches. Pass this way in October and be wooed by a golden hue. Snow patches often blotch the heather meadows, providing the only water along the way. Bottoming out at 6500 feet in a boulder field, the way once again climbs and at 5 miles reaches 7125-foot Grasshopper Pass.<br><br>Don&apos;t call it quits here, however. Continue a little farther on the broad gap, leaving the trail just before it drops steeply to Glacier Pass. Locate well-defined tread heading south, and follow it for about 0.5 mile to a 7125-foot knoll. Now revel in the shadows of all 8000-plus feet of impressive Mount Ballard and Azurite Peak. Admire, too, the prominent cloud-piercing Golden Horn and Tower Peak.

Experienced backpackers will note that Thunder Creek is a gateway to an extensive network of trails.<br><br>The trail begins at a small parking lot near the amphitheater. Quickly enter a nice forest of old cedars, Douglas firs, and giant ferns. Wide and not too rocky, this section of trail is accessible to hikers of all ages.<br><br>Almost immediately, pass an unsigned junction with a trail on your right that heads backwards and uphill. Take note of this trail, because it could be confusing on the way out. Shortly after this junction, come to a signed fork for a nature loop on your right. Continue straight along the creek, enjoying periodic views of the pale green water. Fine glacial sediment is responsible for this color.<br><br>Soon you will come to a sturdy bridge over Thunder Creek.  Cross the bridge and find yourself in Thunder Camp. If you are ready for a break, there are some nice rocks to sit on next to the creek.<br><br>The trail narrows and walking side-by-side will no longer be an option. At 2.1 miles, come to a well signed junction. The trail left leads to Fourth of July Pass. There are views from Fourth of July Camp, but the steep 2.5 mile ascent represents a change in destination rather than a short side-trip.  The best views are from a couple of camp sites, which are less likely to be occupied on Sunday afternoon than on Saturday.<br><br>Continue right, cross a small stream, and quickly arrive at another well signed junction. The trail to the right heads to Neve Camp, with space for five tents. This is a great destination for a family or a first-time backpacker.<br><br>The main trail begins to climb high above the creek. Be careful with kids on the steep side-slope. The forest opens up a little, giving you views of the peaks across the valley. After about a mile, the trail turns away from the creek. Notice the silence for the next half-mile: a small hill is between you and the creek. <br><br>It will be another few miles before the trail and creek are at the same elevation. At this point, the creek is much narrower than before, and the creek edges are much rockier. Keep your eyes open &#x2013;- there is a nice overlook of the creek. This is a fine spot for a break or to turn around.<br><br>If your destination is McAllister Camp, continue on. An impressive washout at a bend in the creek is the signal that you are getting close. Pass the horse camp and look for a well signed junction, with McAllister Hiker Camp to the right. Cross the creek on a sturdy bridge, pausing to appreciate the green water rushing through the narrow canyon. Continue another half mile to the camp, where McAllister Creek joins Thunder Creek. At an elevation of only 1900 feet, this camp makes a good early-season camping destination.</p>\n                 ",

A series of overlooks along the way allows you to admire the surrounding majestic North Cascades summits hovering above, or to marvel at the blue-green waters of the glacier-fed lake twinkling below. Thunder Knob makes a perfect family friendly hike if you&apos;re camping below, or a great leg stretcher if you&apos;re traveling through on the North Cascades Highway. The trail is all accessible too, meaning outdoor lovers confined to wheelchairs can also enjoy this hike. And due to its low elevation, it rarely snows on the knob, allowing for winter rambling in the heart of the North Cascades National Park Complex.<br><br>Begin by walking up the campground road to the trailhead. Via log bridges cross a series of channels cut by Colonial Creek when it jumped its banks in 2003, slicing through the campground and destroying several of my personal favorite car-camping sites in the state. I lament the destruction in one of my favorite retreats, but admire the power and fury of nature. The creek will undoubtedly change course again-nature is dynamic, ever changing, ever in flux.<br><br>After crossing the braided creek come to a wide, dry rocky channel. This is the former creek bed, the one I used to camp by. Now enter a forest of mature hemlocks. Weaving around moss-covered ledges and parting a sea of salal, the wide and well-groomed trail gently works its way up Thunder Knob. Watch the forest transition to one dominated by lodgepole pine. If the terrain surrounding you suddenly seems drier-it is. You&apos;re in a small rain shadow. The towering cloud-piercing peaks help catch and wring out passing rain clouds, providing a little reprieve from precipitation.<br><br>In about 1 mile come to the first of several lookout spots complete with resting benches. Gaze south to Colonial Peak with its large alpine glacier, the source for the campsite-consuming Colonial Creek. Continue easy climbing before dropping slightly into a marshy depression. In ten more minutes reach the broad apex of the knob. A short spur path leads left to an impressive view out over Diablo Lake to Davis Peak, the McMillan Spires, and the narrow Stetattle Creek valley. Sourdough Mountain sticks its west end into the frame.<br><br>Continue a couple of hundred feet to the end of the main trail to yet another viewpoint, this one offering a glimpse of massive Jack Mountain, the supreme summit of the Skagit Valley.\n                 ",

Backpackers can turn around at Park Creek Pass (45.6 miles) or do a traverse to Cascade Pass (41.8 miles). <br><br>Hikers on this trail will marvel at the towering old growth along Thunder Creek. This is truly deep, deep wilderness and hiking the length of Thunder Creek provides ample opportunity to appreciate its nuances and its challenges. On the plus side - the trees, the solitude, creekside camps, a chance to see wildlife. On the minus side - long miles, bugs, and few expansive views of the surrounding peaks. Read WTA&apos;s Hiking Guide Entry for Thunder Creek http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/thunder-creek-1 for more on this stretch, along with recent Trip Reports.<br><br>Once you top out at Park Creek Pass (22.8 miles and 6100&apos;) everything changes. Mountains, meadows, and scrambling opportunities abound. This is a place to stay awhile. Camping isn&apos;t allowed on the pass, but there are good camps on either side. So few people ever make it this far in that you will almost certainly have this wonderland to yourself.<br><br>Now the decision you need to make before you begin. Do you return to the Thunder Creek drainage, covering the same 22 miles you&apos;ve already gone? Or do you arrange a shuttle and head forward, covering untrodden territory to Cascade Pass (41.8 miles)? <br><br>If you can arrange a car at either end, hiking to Cascade Pass offers the most interesting way. You&apos;ll descend the Park Creek trail to the Stehekin Road (7.2 miles on and 2300&apos;). A 2.7 mile road walk lies ahead, but with the road currently closed to vehicles due to a washout, you&apos;re unlikely to encounter cars. <br><br>At Cottonwood Camp, you&apos;ll join up with the Cascade Pass trail. Up, up you&apos;ll go to Cascade Pass (5400&apos;) and finally the last 3.7 miles to your other car - 19 miles from Park Creek Pass.</p>\n                 ",

Both offer wonderful opportunities to travel along burbling, blue-green creeks. And both offer excellent views of the North Cascades and camping possibilities. Go out and back or stash a second car and do a traverse.<br><br>Probably the most scenic way to hike to Fourth of July Pass is from the Colonial Creek Campground on the Thunder Creek trail. The stats on this page reflect this hike. The trail starts out easy as it gently wanders alongside turbulent Thunder Creek for two miles. One-third of a mile past the bridge, reach the trail to Fourth of July Pass on the left. <br><br>Take this trail, which marks the beginning of a steep ascent, climbing 2000 feet in just 2.5 miles to Fourth of July Camp at 3400 feet. You&apos;ll appreciate the cool forest cover as you climb, and when the forest gives way, it&apos;s to spectacular views of Colonial Peak, Snowfield Peak and Neve Glacier as you near the camp. If you&apos;re backpacking, this is the place to stay - some of the camp spots have fabulous views.<br><br>From the camp, it is less than a mile to the pass at 3600 feet. The pass is 5.3 miles from the trailhead. On the way, you&apos;ll pass a nice overlook of the Panther Potholes just short of the pass. The view at the top of the pass echoes what you have seen on the trail -- stunning views of jagged peaks and majestic glaciers.<br><br>Access to the pass from Panther Creek is as follows. Park at the East Bank trailhead between mileposts 138 &amp; 139 on highway 20. This route up to the pass is also pleasant, and takes you alongside a different burbling creek, but while it does have a camp, it is not as scenic. Hikers may also be disheartened when the trail takes a surprising turn downhill after having marched upwards for several hundred feet. <br><br>The best way to see this section is as a traverse from Colonial Creek Campground. If you can arrange a key swap or a shuttle two cars, the whole hike is 11.7 miles of North Cascades trekking through cool forest, high meadows, and beautiful views.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: If you&apos;re camping, note that a backcountry permit is required and is available from North Cascades National Park.\n                 ",

Nevertheless, it&#x2019;s well worth hikers&#x2019; time to venture into these forests and meadows to ascend Fourth of July Pass.<br><br>Fourth of July Pass can be accessed via Panther Creek, described here, or via Thunder Creek: <a href=\"http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/fourth-of-july-pass.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/fourth-of-july-pass.</a> Hikers can go out and back or do a traverse with a car at each end.<br><br>The Panther Creek trail starts in cool lodgepole pine forest, climbing to a traverse underneath a Cliffside at 2000 feet. Here, hikers descend, losing much of the elevation they&#x2019;ve gained, until the trail touches the creek. At that point, it turns up again to aformerly bridged crossing with designated campsites.  From here, the trail crosses small streams and avalanche slopes, and at 2700&#x2019;, 4.75 miles in, contours away from the creek and heads up Fourth of July Pass, one mile and 800&#x2019; later.<br><br>The best views are at the far end of Fourth of July Pass, and the nicest place to camp is about a mile beyond at Fourth of July Camp with views of Colonial Peak, Snowfield Peak and Neve Glacier. <br><br>Probably the best way to see this section is as a traverse from Colonial Creek Campground or the opposite.

Still, this easily accessible trail gets a fair amount of traffic, as it makes for a good spring conditioner or late-fall snow prober. And while Pyramid Lake is tiny, some of the trees along the way are anything but small. The real allure of this trail is the impressive old-growth forest it traverses, compensating for any lake letdown<br><br>The trail starts right beside Pyramid Creek. Catch its cool breezes, and then immediately get to work climbing. Under a thin canopy of lodgepole pine, work your way up a ledge. It&apos;s slow going, with roots, loose rocks, and tread-choking salal. Hang in there-it gets better.<br><br>Marching up a rib above the crashing creek, periodically peer over your shoulder through the sparse forest cover for glimpses of Davis Peak and Sourdough Mountain across the Skagit Valley.

Actually, there is if you look at this body of water through ecological instead of aesthetic eyes. Rough-skinned newts, those adorable amphibians of the Northwest, thrive here. Look for them floating near the surface and hiding in the detritus. And those big ol&apos; logs floating in the lake harbor scads of sundew, a carnivorous plant. No need for you or the newts to worry, though-they prefer insects.<br><br>If after observing some of nature&apos;s fascinating creations, you still desire a view, try wiggling around the lakeshore a bit and you may catch a glimpse or two of not-so-puny Pyramid Peak poking out above.\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Ruby Mountain is a 7408 foot peak in the center of the North Cascades. It has one of the best panoramic views of the lakes, snow-capped peaks and glaciers of the North Cascades National Park. The mountain has a very high prominence for its modest elevation: on the list of Washington&apos;s most prominent peaks, Ruby Mountain is number 21 with 3888 feet of prominence.<br><br>The Ruby Mountain trail is only maintained by boots, and is closer to a scramble than a casual stroll on a well-maintained trail. The trail was not officially developed, but unlike most bootpaths, this trail is fairly well-graded. Thanks to the relative popularity of Ruby Mountain, following the trail is doable, but good navigation skills, and a good nose for finding the bootpath are highly recommended.<br><br>When the National Park was established in 1968, Ruby Mountain was considered for a viewpoint reachable by a tramway. The tramway was intended to allow all visitors of the North Cascades to appreciate the area.  While this would certainly have been a magnificent place to enjoy the scenery, the project was abandoned. Though the project had relatively widespread support, it was delayed due to the high cost. In the meantime, new environmental protection laws had been introduced and the Park Service expected difficulties in complying with this legislation. The cost and the environmental concerns then caused the project to be entirely abandoned. More recently, the Ruby Mountain trail was considered for official maintenance, but an assessment of the impact on the fragile area resulted in a dismissal of this plan as well.<br><br>The Ruby Mountain trail is located in the Ross Lake National Recreation Area, which means that it is one of the few trails in this area of the North Cascades that can be hiked with a dog. Good campsites are available at Thunder and Fourth of July Camp, but camping is also possible high on the ridge of Ruby Mountain. The Fourth of July Camp has a permanent water source. On top of Ruby Mountain there is snow available throughout the year on the north-east side. This slope still has some glacial remnants as well. If you plan to camp at the top, make sure to bring enough gas in case melting snow is required.<br><br>During the summer, Ruby Mountain is usually accessed from the Thunder Creek trailhead and the Fourth of July Pass. The trailhead is all the way at the back of the Colonial Creek Campground with an elevation of 1200 feet. The first 4 miles are to Fourth of July Pass, which has a separate guide entry with more details. From the trailhead, the long climb starts gently, with a very minor incline on the trail that runs parallel to the impressive Thunder Creek. After crossing the bridge, the trail runs through Thunder campground, then starts climbing a bit more. Soon there is a clearly indicated intersection with the Panther Creek trail at about 1300 feet that leads to the Fourth of July Pass. More serious climbing begins now, with two series of switchbacks, one right after the intersection, and one when approaching the pass. During the climb occasionally nice views open up on Colonial Peak, Snowfield Peak and the Neve Glacier, and Primus Peak. These views only get better while ascending, but the mountains are beautiful enough that the climb is immediately enjoyable. The climb to the pass crosses a few creeks that may run into late summer, depending on the snowpack.<br><br>After climbing to 3400 feet, the relatively flat Fourth of July Pass area begins with an intersection of trails to the Fourth of July Camp. This is not the actual pass yet, but the views at this point are the best until much higher on Ruby Mountain. Continue straight towards the pass through a mostly flat, swampy area. This is the point where route-finding is required. <br><br>The beginning of the Ruby Mountain trail is not clearly marked, and a bit obscured. Fortunately, there is clear landmark: the top of the pass has two small bridges across creeks, first a small one, and second a bridge about 30 feet long. The Ruby Mountain trail begins right before the larger, second bridge, to the left. It is easily recognizable after hiking a few feet down the trail. After a few dozen yards on the trail there is warning sign that the trail is not maintained.<br><br>The first half mile of the Ruby Mountain trail runs through forest with not much undergrowth, and the trail is fairly easy to follow here. The area does have many blowdowns, but the trees are not that big, so they do not present a problem. Make sure to pay attention to hints of the bootpath. If the bootpath is not visible for more than half a minute, then most likely you&#x2019;ve lost the trail.<br><br>At about 4200 feet the trail enters a gully with much more blowdown and less moss, making the trail harder to follow. Pay close attention to hints of the bootpath. At the time of writing, hikers have put single rocks on blowdowns for guidance.<br><br>The trail eventually enters more open forest with brushy undergrowth and traverses from the west side to the east side of the ridge at 4900 feet. Due to the undergrowth the trail is easier to follow again here, but it is not very wide and the terrain is fairly steep. Poles come in handy here.<br><br>After a long, well-graded ascent on the east side of the ridge, the sensible grade of the trail is suddenly abandoned and the trail climbs fairly steeply through a more rocky area back to the center of the ridge at 5800 feet. This is where views start opening up really nicely, with particularly nice views of the Neve and Boston Glacier.<br><br>From the 5800 foot rocky area back on the center of the ridge, hikers have followed multiple bootpaths. The original trail continues straight to traverse the west-side of the ridge, where it becomes a bit more brushy, but the trail remains visible and easily distinguishable. Others have chosen to follow the center of the ridge, which is an easier option in winter and spring.<br><br>Continuing on the west side of the ridge, a fairly long traverse without switchbacks climbs to 6200 feet, eventually entering a large slope of blueberry bushes, and starts climbing steeply with switchbacks until 6600 feet. The way is still remarkably well graded for a bootpath. And the views from the meadow are stunning, with the most spectacular views on Mounts Baker and Shuksan, Bacon Peak in the northwest and in the southwest, Forbidden Peak, Boston Peak, Bonanza, Mount Logan, and many more peaks and glaciers.<br><br>At 6600 feet a small flat area interrupts the climbing. The terrain becomes more high alpine here and snow lingers deep into the summer. The 7200-foot ridge of Ruby Mountain is visible from this point, with a steep rock and grass slope between you and victory. Unfortunately, the trail mostly disappears here and the remainder of the climb to 7200 feet is a scramble through the rocks. If no snow needs to be crossed, then it is not a dangerous climb, but the slope does feel a bit exposed. A snow-free climb is normally possible half-way through July.<br><br>Once you reach the ridge, the fantastic 360 panorama opens up. You can see Jack and Crater Mountain in the northeast, which are particularly beautiful when there is still some snow early in the year. The walk over the ridge has a couple of false summits, but the walk is such a delight that you will wish there were more! Finally, at the peak there is an amazing view of Ross and Diablo Lakes (with strikingly different colors), and virtually every significant peak of the North Cascades. Ruby Mountain has a summit register, and a large radio system used by the rangers of the North Cascades National Park for their operations.<br><br>For very strong hikers Ruby Mountain is possible as a day-hike, but enjoying the sunrise and sunset from the mountain is a memorable experience, so an overnight is recommended.<br><br>The trailhead is before the point where SR 20 closes for winter, so it is also possible to climb Ruby Mountain in winter or early spring. In winter some prefer a steep, shorter route straight up from SR 20 using the north-west ridge of Ruby Mountain. The route via the Fourth of July Pass is also possible, but it is then better to simply follow the entire southwest ridge up instead of attempt to follow the trail, which traverses some steeper slopes. For more route information on those options please consult snowshoeing or cross-country skiing guides.<br><br>No permit or fee is required for entering the Ross Lake National Recreation Area, nor for parking at the trailhead. A free permit is required for backcountry camping, which can be obtained at the Wilderness Information Center in Marblemount. See the National Park Service website for more information on the permits. Dispersed (crosscountry) camping is allowed only on durable surfaces and 1 mile from established campsites.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: An alternative route to the Fourth of July Pass would be to start at the other end of the Panther Creek trail from SR-20, but this trail does run through the National Park, so dogs are not allowed. The approach is also about 1.5 mile longer than the approach via the Thunder Creek.</p>\n                 ",

The trail can accommodate a range of hiking interests, from short day hikes to overnight backpacking excursions. And thanks to the trail&#x2019;s low elevation, it is accessible even when most other Cascadian trails are buried under snow.<br><br>The trail flanks the eastern edge of Baker Lake, created by the 1959 damming of the Baker River. Starting from either the north or south trailhead, hikers will encounter a forest of maturing Douglas firs. Cedar used to dominate, but the 1843 eruption of Mount Baker triggered a forest fire, reducing the old-growth cedars to burnt snags.<br><br>Cedar remains among the towering firs provide evidence of this historical event. Along the trail, foliage, fungus, lichen and moss never fail to impress. Mushrooms dot the forest floor allowing hikers to forage for fabulous fungus as they traipse through the woods, and the towering trees draped with old man&#x2019;s beard provide shelter from the drizzly mist that accompanies most winter hikes in the Northwest.<br><br>Numerous cascading creeks cross the trail as they make their way from the mountains above to the lake water below. Sturdy bridges span these tributaries keeping your feet dry and your brain pondering how a trail crew could build such a strong structure in the wilderness. Most impressive of all is the suspension bridge over the rushing Baker River, just a half-mile from the northern trailhead. (To hike this trail from the northern trailhead, see the East Bank Baker Lake entry from Craig Romano&apos;s Day Hiking the North Cascades http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/baker-lake). <br><br>Located intermittently along the trail, several campgrounds provide a temporary homestead for backpackers and logical turnaround point for day hikers. All camping areas are complete with fire pits and vault or backcountry toilets.<br><br>You&apos;ll find the Maple Grove campground about 4 miles from the southern trailhead. Sitting on the eastern shore of Baker Lake, this sweet little spot has six tent campsites. <br><br>A wonderful trail for getting outdoors in the midst of winter (without snowshoes or skis), the Baker Lake Trail makes a marvelous wilderness escape any time of year.<br><br>Post-hike: Drop into the Birdsview Brewing Company on Hwy 20.<br><br>by Lindsay Leffelman</p>\n                 ",

Up the deep and forbidding Canyon Creek valley, prospectors and profiteers pushed on to Harts Pass and its fields of gold and other minerals and to the boomtowns of Chancellor and Barron. But alas, most of the mines went bust along with the miners. Towns vanished and the Chancellor Road transformed into peaceful trail, traversing a once-again wild corner of the North Cascades.<br><br>Sharing a start with the Jackita Ridge Trail, head into noisy forest, thanks to the thundering of crashing creeks. At 0.2 mile, just after crossing Granite Creek on a durable bridge, come to a junction. The trail left heads to Ruby Creek and Crater Mountain. Head right on the Chancellor Trail for your journey up the deep and lonely Canyon Creek.<br><br>The trail starts by steeply switchbacking over lateral moraine left behind long ago by receding glaciers. Be sure to catch a glimpse of Canyon Creek crashing below; for most of this hike it&apos;ll remain hidden in a narrow and inaccessible chasm. Through dark forest, continue climbing. In late spring thousands of calypso orchids help perk up the forest floor in purple.<br><br>While Canyon Creek is now firmly out of view, its raucous bellowing never leaves you. Enjoy occasional glimpses through the trees of cascading creeks careening down Crater Mountain across the valley. The way soon levels off and even begins to head a little downward. At about 2 miles reach a signed short side trail to Rowleys Chasm (elev. 2400 ft). Exercising extreme caution, check out this vertigo-inducing cleft in the canyon wall, named after an early prospector. The rugged side trail continues, heading down to still-active claims.<br><br>Back on the Chancellor Trail, pass a nice view upvalley, and then cross a trio of cascading creeks before swinging around a ledge (elev. 2500 ft) high above Canyon Creek. Pause here to take in an excellent view down the canyon and out to Ruby Mountain. Beyond, the trail crosses Holmes Creek before steeply dropping 200 feet to Boulder Creek, 3.5 miles from your start and a good turnaround spot.

Views to the west are commanded by the ever-changing face of Jack Mountain as you hike counter-clockwise around it. Take your time on this hike--most people take between 4 and 5 days in order to fully appreciate every mile. <br><br>From Devil&apos;s Pass, roughly a third of the way through your hike, the high point lies a little more than 5 miles down the trail: Devil&apos;s Dome. From here you can enjoy views of Spratt Mountain to the north, Jack Mountain to the south, Ross Lake and the peaks across it to the west, and behind you, peer into the sprawling Pasayten wilderness.

Along with unobstructed panoramic views of Mount Baker, the Twin Sisters, and the rest of the North Cascades, the route to Park Butte offers campsites, wildflower-filled alpine meadows, rushing waterfalls, and a stunning variety of mushroom species.<br><br>Park Butte is one of the most popular Mount Baker area hikes for a variety of reasons: unobstructed mountain views, a moderately steep trail with access to campsites, and an open, maintained historic fire lookout built in 1932. The Forest Service now uses advanced technology to search for fires, but decades ago fire lookouts proliferated on the peaks of the Cascades. One of the few remaining intact lookouts is on Park Butte; it is maintained through the volunteer efforts of the Skagit Alpine Club.<br><br>The trail leaves the parking area at 3250 feet of elevation and heads west, crossing a bridge over Sulphur Creek and passing through Schrieber&#x2019;s Meadow. At 0.1 mile, on the right, is the first intersection with the Scott Paul Trail. Continue left through the meadow, enjoying wildflower overload in the summer and a berry bonanza in the autumn; species that grow here include heather, salmonberry, blueberry, huckleberry, fireweed, lupine, and pearly everlasting. As you ascend with rushing Sulphur Creek and its waterfalls on your right, see how many mushrooms you can identify; a partial list includes yellow cracked bolete, peppery bolete, blackfoot paxillus, northern Russula, sharp-scaled lepiota, deadly lepiota, and fly amanita. WTA has performed trailwork here, building puncheon to maintain a trail through myriad rivulets of the boggy meadow.<br><br>After 0.7 miles, leave the meadow to cross Rocky Creek and the boulder fields through which it passes. Sometimes a ladder bridge is necessary to cross the main &#x201C;channel,&#x201D; which frequently changes position. Note that cairns may mark the locations where you should enter and leave the boulder fields. Once across Rocky Creek, the terrain changes as you enter old-growth forest, and the grade stiffens a bit. Take in the mountain hemlocks and yellow cedar that surround you as you switchback up and to the northwest. At two miles, you reach the second junction with the Scott Paul Trail, at 4400 feet. Continue left, and enter Morovitz Meadow, where Koma Kulshan presides over fields of heather, mountain ash, wildflower, and vaccinia berry bushes that blaze flaming red in fall.<br><br>In 0.4 miles come to the junction with the Railroad Grade Trail, which leads to the Easton Glacier and is a frequently-used route for summiting Baker. Stay left and descend to Bell Pass Junction, passing through boggy meadows. After 0.6 miles keep left and ascend again for 0.7 miles over rocky tread to Park Butte, which now dominates the view opposite Koma Kulshan. Skirt boulder fields as pika brashly squeak &#x201C;eep!&#x201D; at passersby. On your left, pass&#x2014;or visit&#x2014;a series of tarns that reflect the summit block of Baker on clear days. Just before you make the final push to the lookout, take in Pocket Lake below you and to the southeast.<br><br>When you reach the lookout, at 5450 feet elevation, take care as you climb the ladder. Sign the lookout register, or even pen an entry in the poetry register. Gnarled mountain hemlocks, subalpine fir, and noble fir surround the lookout. Directly north are the Black Buttes, Lincoln and Colfax. To the southwest are the Twin Sisters, and the Nooksack River valley heads west to the horizon. And if the fates favor you with a sunny day, bask in the views of the sheer white glaciers of Koma Kulshan.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: first-come, first-served camping overnight is available in the fire lookout. Arrival (at the lookout) as early as 10 or 11 am may be necessary to snag this perk!</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    Depending on the starting snow elevation, this may be a wonderful day hike in wide meadows or a long, overnight trek through forests before reaching those alpine clearings. Regardless, this route is a jewel for winter enthusiasts. Expect to share the road and trail with cross-country skiers and probably a few snowmobilers, although midweek or after mid-January (after the typical holiday rush to the hills) finds the setting tranquil and uncrowded. But even if others are along the route, there is plenty of wild country and beautiful scenery for all to share. The great white cone of Mount Baker looms over the trail to the north, while the broad, undulating snowfields of Schriebers Meadow beckon one and all out into the untracked expanses for a moment of wintry solitude.<br><br>If the snow is heavy, park at the Sno-Park and begin a 5-mile trek along the wide, forested corridor of FR 13. This leads up a pair of switchbacks before tapering in a long, climbing traverse along the hillside above Sulphur Creek. The road ends at a broad parking area marking the trailhead for the Schriebers Meadow-Park Butte Trail. This road section provides a good stretch for the legs without an excessive workout, leaving you with plenty of energy for snowshoeing through the wondrous meadows above.<br><br>At the road end, the route jumps onto the narrow trail, crossing Sulphur Creek before climbing in a short 0.25 mile to the lower edge of Schriebers Meadow. This world of white is a paradise of winter recreation. Skiers are sure to be found slashing down the slopes flanking the meadows, and on busy Saturdays in January, expect to hear the whine of a few snowmobiles, too. To find solitude, angle off into the untracked reaches of the meadows. To the south, climb up a moderate slope for 0.25 mile or so to reach a basin with three or four ice-covered alpine tarns. Here the views of Mount Baker are at their ultimate best, and good campsites are found in this area, too. Just pick a spot big enough for a tent on the leeward side of the hill, with a glade of trees flanking your site for added shelter from storms in February. <br><br>Another alternative is to push on for a longer snowshoe trek to Survey Point, by crossing the flat meadows to the northwest and then starting a gradual climb between two long rocky ridges. These ridges are lateral moraines--rock piles that were pushed aside by flowing glaciers. Climb this wide trough, and in about 1.5 miles from the end of the road, cross the upper reaches of Rocky Creek. Use care here because the many seemingly solid snow bridges may be weak and unsafe, especially late in the season or after periods of unusually warm weather. After you cross the creek, the climbing is steep and steady for another 0.5 mile. Then bear left (west), and traverse a long, open slope to reach the top of the ridge of the left-hand moraine for stunning views of Mount Baker, the sprawling white blanket of Schriebers Meadow, and the high peaks of Park and Black Buttes to the west.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope.\n                 ",

Along the way, soak in sweeping views of the North Cascades, gaze at Koma Kulshan&#x2019;s glistening glaciers, munch on an inexhaustible supply of berries, and marvel at old-growth western hemlock forest.<br><br>In the early 1990s Forest Ranger Scott Paul conceived of the Sulphur Moraine Trail that would climb from old-growth western hemlock forest to the moraines at the foot of Mount Baker. He was supervising construction of a suspension bridge near Lincoln City, Oregon in 1993, when a cable snapped, wrapped around him, and plunged into a gorge. The Sulphur Moraine Trail was subsequently renamed to memorialize the man who designed this diverse and beautifully crafted alpine passageway.<br><br>The Scott Paul Trail is arguably easiest on the feet and more rewarding to the eyes when traveled in the clockwise direction. Start at the Park Butte trailhead, taking the main trail 603, and passing the first junction with the Scott Paul Trail and the wildflowers of Schrieber&#x2019;s Meadow. Continue across the appropriately named Rocky Creek and into old-growth hemlock forest, reaching the second junction with the Scott Paul Trail 603.1 at 4500 feet and after two miles on the Park Butte Trail.<br><br>At the clearly marked sign, turn right and descend gently through the forest and skirting the Railroad Grade, one of Koma Kulshan&#x2019;s glacier-deposited ridges that extends radially from the mountain. The terrain changes to alpine, with scant trees, myriad wildflowers (lupine, fireweed, and arnica predominate), and an unending gauntlet of blueberry and huckleberry bushes that flame crimson in the autumn. Watch mountaineers ascend the moraine on their way to base camp. The trail parallels the Railroad Grade for a short distance before descending to Rocky Creek. A suspension bridge is present from July through September, and it is recommended to check with the Forest Service beforehand as to whether the bridge is in place. Otherwise, this could be the most challenging ford on the trail. Ascend again, steadily climbing and weaving between moraines. As you climb along Metcalf Moraine, soak in the views of Baker&#x2019;s snow cone to your north. As you double back, gaze upon Glacier Peak, Three Fingers, and Whitehorse to the south.<br><br>After 1.5 miles, reach a high point at 5200 feet. For the next 2 miles, the trail follows the contour of Baker&#x2019;s base. The tread on this segment is rocky, and there are steep inclines to your side, so step carefully. After what seems like an interminable series of switchbacks and creek valley crossings, drop into the valley of Sulphur Creek, the fourth major creek for those counting. Some of the fordings, including this one, can be challenging, depending on rainfall and glacial runoff. Soon you will come to a boggy meadow, at elevation 4600 feet, with views of Sherman Peak (Baker&#x2019;s summit) and Mount Shuksan. The vistas of these peaks are breathtaking.<br><br>At this point you will begin to descend into old-growth mountain and western hemlock forest; the full variety of this area&#x2019;s mushrooms on prominent display. Continue downward 2.5 miles, eventually paralleling Sulphur Creek. When you hear the rush of water, you are nearing the junction with the Park Butte Trail. Cross a wooden bridge over Sulphur Creek, and turn left at the next intersection to finish the loop. You will be back at the trailhead 0.1 miles later.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: If you&apos;re including the loop in your visit to the Park Butte lookout, the round trip hike is 11.5 miles. If hiking late in the season, bring ample lighting or start early enough to avoid finishing in the dark.</p>\n                 ",

Both destinations will cost you dearly in caloric output. Lots of elevation gain over steep and rough terrain is what keeps this day-hike-accessible corner of the North Cascades National Park from being overrun.<br><br>The trail starts at the edge of a huge clear-cut from the early 1960s. If the North Cascades National Park hadn&apos;t been created in 1968, you could bet your weight in sawdust that many more of these surrounding slopes would have been severely scarred. Begin on decommissioned logging road-turned-trail and hike 2.3 easy miles, crossing Thornton and a few minor creeks en route.<br><br>After gaining only a couple of hundred feet, the trail leaves the old roadbed and heads straight up deeply forested and mucky- at times slopes. Never commissioned by the Parks Service, this trail was beaten into the ground long ago by anglers lured in by the three Thornton gems.<br><br>Enter the North Cascades National Park at about 4 miles and continue steeply climbing, coming to a 5000-foot saddle and trail junction at 4.5 miles. Decision time. Should you head left to the lake basin, dropping 500 feet (which you&apos;ll need to regain on the return) in 0.6 mile, or climb another 900 feet in 0.8 mile to the peak? Either way, you have to climb some more.<br><br>The lake trail ends at the rocky outlet of the largest and lowest of the Thorntons (elev. 4500 ft), in a cirque that doesn&apos;t leave much room for spreading out. The other two lakes require challenging cross-country travel, so break out the snacks and be content at the first lake.<br><br>If Trapper bound, follow the trail right, another never-sanctioned path, this one beaten by climbers up, up, and away. The going gets steep along a narrow ridge, and at times requires the help of hands. It&apos;s not exposed, though, and not particularly difficult for seasoned hikers. From the 5964-foot summit, find yourself a nice rock to rest upon and prepare for an onslaught of sensory overload. One of the most awesome ranges in the Cascades-the sheer and jagged Pickets-charge across the northern horizon.<br><br>Shimmering directly below are the Thornton Lakes. Directly above them, glacier-decorated Mount Triumph stands victoriously. To the south 1 vertical mile below, the Skagit River slices through steep verdant slopes, the little company town of Newhalem perched quaintly upon its banks.

From Mount Constitution&apos;s unique stone tower savor stunning views of snow-capped peaks and emerald islands spanning from British Columbia&apos;s Garibaldi all the way to Rainier. After fawning and awing, walk along the edge of precipitous cliffs gazing at the twinkling waters of Mountain Lake 1000-feet below. This is the heart of Moran State Park, and when it comes to pure scenery, wildlife observations, and top-notch trails, you&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find an area surpassing this.<br><br>For both loops, begin by walking 0.25 mile down a dirt road to the boat launch. Here, the trail takes off north, hugging the western shore of Mountain Lake. This section of trail is named for Bonnie Sliger, a popular Youth Conservation Corps supervisor who tragically died in a fall in 1977.<br><br>Skirting the placid shoreline graced with mature timber, keep your eyes and ears tuned for woodpeckers, eagles, ducks, and osprey. Watch too for kingfishers and heron. While you&apos;re scoping for birds, a few of Moran&apos;s ubiquitous black-tailed deer will probably be watching you.<br><br>In 1.25 miles reach a junction. To continue circling 200-acre Mountain Lake, proceed right. Meandering along pristine shoreline, the trail carries on with its easy journey. A small ledge requiring a climb of 50 feet or so is the only break from near-level hiking on the entire loop. At 3.25 miles reach a small dam at the lake&apos;s southern tip. From this point enjoy good views of Mount Constitution, cliffs and tower revealed, hovering above the lake.<br><br>Avoiding a side trail leading to Mount Pickett, continue by crossing Cascade Creek on a bridge just below the dam. Here another trail diverges left, this one following Cascade Creek and leading to falls and lake of same name. Head right, hugging more Mountain Lake shoreline and closing the loop.<br><br>Mount Constitution-bound hikers should head left at 1.25 miles from the trailhead onto the Twin Lakes Trail, at the junction that comes along as you&apos;re hiking the lakeshore. Follow the well-trodden path for 1 mile, gaining an easy 200 feet of elevation to another junction (elev. 1100 ft). Trails leading to the little Twins and to Mount Pickett take off right.<br><br>You, however, are headed left. Take a break-you&apos;ve got quite a climb ahead of you. In deep timber, begin your ascent. The trail steepens, gaining 1000 feet in less than a mile as it works its way up Constitution. En route ignore a trail taking off right (North Trail), but consider the spurs leading left to nice viewpoints.<br><br>At 4 miles from your start, emerge on 2409-foot Mount Constitution&apos;s broad summit. Don&apos;t let gawking tourists who drove to the summit detract from your experience; well-earned views await. Head for Constitution&apos;s unique stone tower. Constructed by Civilian Conservation Corps crews in 1936, it&apos;s a facsimile of a twelfth-century Caucasus Mountains military fortification. From this roof top of the San Juan Islands, enjoy an unobstructed view of island, mountain, Sound, and strait from the Olympics to Rainier, Vancouver Island to British Columbia&apos;s Coast Range.<br><br>Now it&apos;s time to amend your views on Constitution, adding to the sights seen by continuing your hike. Leave the summit and crowds via the Little Summit Trail. Losing very little elevation, saunter for a mile on the summit plateau through stands of lodgepole pine and along the edge of sheer cliffs plummeting straight down to Mountain Lake.<br><br>After skirting frog-incubating Summit Lake, bear left at a junction (the trail right leads to Cold Springs and Cascade Lake), and in another mile reach another junction (elev. 1900 ft), bearing left once again. Begin your at times steep descent back to Mountain Lake, arriving at your vehicle and closing the loop in 0.75 mile.</p>\n                 ",

Four-legged users, however, abound, especially deer. After late June when the balsamroot blossoms turn to seed, the butte is hot and dry. Carry plenty of water and sunscreen. Early season is best for a visit, but expect to encounter some snow midway; routefinding is easy if the skies are clear.<br><br>Begin with a very short stretch of level walking before heading up an old skid road. Through an open forest of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, waste no time gaining elevation. At 0.5 mile the trail swings east to slab up a sunny southern slope. Thousands of sunflowers, as balsamroot is colloquially called in these parts, help brighten the way. The trail was once used to drive cattle to the butte&apos;s high meadows for range, hence this peak&apos;s name.

The way levels as it enters what was once dense forest, now burnt snags and feisty new undergrowth thanks to a large wildfire that swept through shortly after the millennium. Near a creek crossing (dry by midsummer) a faint path leads right 0.5 mile to a 5500-foot view-granting knoll, an option for a shorter saunter.<br><br>The main trail continues left through a matchstick forest, crossing-depending on the season-either a series of snowmelt streams or dry draws. At 3.25 miles (elev. 5500 ft) the trail turns right (northeast), emerging in meadows and parkland below the butte.

To the north, 8726-foot Robinson Mountain dominates the horizon, and Lost River is fully revealed. Look east down the Methow Valley with Goat Peak hovering above. Giants Gardner and Silver Star draw your attention southward, while the Harts Pass high country piques your interest to the west.

Expect to see snakes on these sunny basking spots, but not necessarily the ones that rattle. Once I spotted a rubber boa along the trail, a rather odd but interesting reptile.

While the trail to its summit may inflict a little pain during its early steep stretches, you soon gain sweeping views from the floor of the valley to the tops of the airy summits of the North Cascades. <br><br>The trail begins in subalpine forest opening up to the occasional meadow of wildflowers.  The trail follows a broad ridge, so every open space brings with it views to nearby peaks. In two thirds of a mile, you reach a steep section that is mercifully brief &#x2013; after another two thirds of a mile and 800 vertical feet, attain a more pronounced ridge from which the lookout first comes into sight. From this vantage the lookout seems to tower over the Gardner Range to the south. A mostly level walk through windswept fields takes you to a final short climb. On the last turn before the summit, you&#x2019;ll pass a massive cairn dedicated to the prior fire lookouts. <br><br>The summit is dominated, of course, by the lookout itself. While most of its brethren scattered across the state have long been rendered obsolete by observations from the air, it remains a working part of the forest fire detection system. For nineteen straight years, the lookout was staffed full-time during fire season by Bill Austin, who has developed a bit of a cult following as &#x201C;Lightning Bill.&#x201D; In 2014, the decision to staff the Leecher Lookout outside of Twisp moved him further down the valley. The Goat Peak lookout is now on call, staffed when approaching storms warrant an extra set of eyes. <br><br>As you would expect from a peak with a lookout, the views range far and wide. To the south, it looks as if you&#x2019;re level with Gardner Mountain and North Gardner Mountain (even though they&#x2019;re more than 1,000 feet taller). To the north, rolling ridges and the occasional sharper peak extend into the Pasayten Wilderness. Off to the southwest, Silver Star Mountain cracks a toothy, glaciated grin, yet another of the North Cascades&#x2019; taller peaks. <br><br>With so many geographic features containing the word &#x201C;goat&#x201D; within a stone&#x2019;s throw of the trail (Goat Peak, Goat Creek, Goat Wall &#x2013; even the town name of Mazama denotes a kind of goat), you might think time on the summit would be well spent looking for mountain goats; but a search of trip reports by WTA members over the past four years turns up no mention of them. There have supposedly been sporadic reports of goat sightings in and around the climbing routes of the nearby Goat Wall, but a search of reports from climbers also turns up nothing. Joan Burton&#x2019;s 2006 book on hiking with kids in Western Washington mentions that the population of mountain goats here was, unfortunately, &#x201C;slaughtered&#x201D; in the 1920&#x2019;s. If true, it&#x2019;s a stunning reminder of the lasting impact such an action can have. On not-so-distant hikes like Blue Lake, mountain goats are common, and yet they still have not returned to this part of the valley, nearly a century later. <br><br>What Goat Peak lacks in wildlife, however, it makes up for in larches. In fall, it is one of the finest spots for viewing their golden hues. They grow here in several unusually dense groves on the western slopes along the top of the ridge, the first coming just a little over a mile from the trailhead. <br><br>Between the distant tall peaks and the nearby larches, Goat Peak puts much of what makes the North Cascades so incredible within easy reach. If you&#x2019;re looking to introduce kids, family or non-hiking friends to the rewards of hiking, it is a supremely good place to visit.</p>\n                 ",

Long admired by locals, this 1,576 acre preserve was acquired in 2006 through a cooperative fundraising effort. On Turtleback Mountain, you can hike in relative solitude, especially compared to the bustle of nearby Moran State Park.<br><br>You have two choices of trailheads. The south entrance accesses the Garry oak/prairie habitat and leads to spectacular island vistas. This hike is about three miles round trip and offers nonstop views of pastoral farmlands and the surrounding San Juan Islands. From the parking lot, head 0.4 miles along the trail and fork left onto the Lost Oak Trail. Turn right where the trail branches after 0.5 miles and continue the loop that takes you past West Overlook and back to the feeder South Trail, where you turn left to return to the parking lot.<br><br>If you prefer a more traditional Pacific Northwest hike, opt for the North route. This is a longer, steeper hike through quiet old-growth forest with views northward towards Waldron Island. From the parking lot follow the North Trail for 2.1 miles, taking detours to the various overlooks along the way. When you come to a fork, go right for 0.2 miles. <br><br>If you want to make a small loop, take a left at the next junction and wind your way back on the trail you came on. If you&#x2019;re looking for a longer hike, continue on another 0.7 miles on the Center Loop Trail. Veer left away from the Ridge Trail and after 0.6 miles turn right to continue your big loop back to the original North Trail. Turn right on the North Trail and make your way back to the parking lot.<br><br>In 2013, WTA work parties have worked with the Preserve to expand another 150 acres with land owned by the San Juan Preservation Trust.

A dedicated group of enthusiastic WTA volunteers worked countless hours here, carving a connector trail out of the steep, rugged hillside from the top of Cleator Road to the South Lost Lake Trail. The Rock Trail provides hikers and trail runners a steep climb, gorgeous views, and a peek at the area&apos;s fascinating geology. <br><br>From the large parking lot at the Cleator Road trailhead, hikers get sneak peeks of Puget Sound through the trunks and branches of tall trees that surround the crown of the hill. But the trail begins descending almost immediately.  Though the way is steep -- count the number of stairs you encounter -- the route provides plenty of opportunity to enjoy the beauty of Larrabee State Park. <br><br>Within a half-mile  of the upper trailhead are 100-foot high  sandstone cliffs pocked by little holes and large caves. Enormous mossy boulders lie all around you. This area provides an excellent diversion or rest stop for young hikers .<br><br>While unusual sandstone formations are common at Larrabee State Park, hikers typically find them near the beach. But the cliffs on the Rock Trail are interesting because they share characteristics with the seaside rocks, despite being far removed from the shoreline. <br><br>After exploring the imposing rocks, keep heading down through moss and licorice ferns, crossing a creek via &quot;Bogaards Bridge&quot;, named for the WTA crew leaders who helped make the trail a reality.  Be sure to look up and out as you hike; on clear days, Mount Baker and the Twin Sisters glide into view just past the bridge. <br><br>Continuing down, hikers clamber down three steep sets of stairs and wind through three more switchbacks until the trail flattens out. A huge boulder to the right of the trail, about three-quarters of a mile in , hides an interesting cave for exploring. <br><br>From here the junction with the South Lost Lake Trail is quite close. Press on, and note how high the trees soar above your head! At the beginning of your hike, you could see over the tops of some of the trees whose bases you&apos;re now walking by. <br><br>The end of the Rock Trail is marked by a wooden gate with a sign that indicates &apos;Hiker Only.&apos;  The steepness of the trail is prohibitive to stock and mountain bikers, but other trails in Larrabee State Park are multi-use .

The forest lands of Blanchard Mountain became state trust lands in the 1920s and 1930s, giving the forest a needed respite. Much of the forest on Blanchard is second-growth; logging artifacts can be seen on the trail, and giant stumps inspire imagination about the towering cathedral forests that blanketed the mountain prior to logging. <br><br>The trailhead is located along Chuckanut Drive. The trail immediately starts climbing steeply. A kiosk states that you are following the Pacific Northwest Trail, which will connect Glacier National Park to the Olympic coast when complete. You will also pass an intriguing piece of trailside sculpture, &#x201C;Rock Talk,&#x201D; as you ascend the initial segment. The trail switchbacks steeply through second-growth alder, Western red cedar, and Douglas fir forest up the flank of Blanchard Mountain, for approximately one mile. <br><br>At the one-mile mark there is an overlook with a bench that offers a sneak preview of the vista that is to be found at the destination. Take a short break, then continue through the forest another one-half mile to a junction, at which point the Pacific Northwest Trail continues up and to the right. Stay to the left on the Samish Bay Connector trail. The elevation gain becomes gentler as you cross several small creeks. This area receives substantial rainfall, and turnpike builders have devoted much hard work to reducing the numbers of waterspots and mudholes.<br><br>After another one-half mile, the grade steepens, and the trail becomes more rooty. Watch your steps on the ascent and descent, as the tread can be slippery. 1.5 miles from the departure of the Pacific Northwest Trail, you will come to a junction with the trail to Lily and Lizard Lakes. A turn to the right takes you to the lakes; continue to the left on the trail to Oyster Dome, which is now one-quarter mile away. The trail climbs steeply, crosses a creek, and heads left on the Rock Trail (not to be confused with the Rock Trail to Lost Lake in Larrabee State Park!) <br><br>One-tenth of a mile past the creek crossing, you will emerge from the forest onto the rocky promontory called Oyster Dome.

The mountain features a unique prairie habitat with a wide variety of flowering flora, small areas of wetlands and maturing forest. The 70-acre Guemes Mountain Conservation Area is at the center of a larger 534-acre area of protected private and public lands (see map). The protection of Guemes Mountain has ensured that this scenic location is maintained in a natural state for the public to enjoy.<br><br>The hike climbs gradually through the woods to the top of Guemes Mountain. This short hike is a lovely treat year round. In late spring you are treated to wild roses and dozens of other little blooms along the rocky top. On a clear summer day you can see not only the surrounding islands but all the way to Canada&apos;s peaks. And in the fall you will be treated to autumn colors that speckle the lands below.<br><br>Do note that this is a day hiking site only, and camping, fires, motorized vehicles, bikes and horses are not allowed.\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Don&#x2019;t be fooled by the name &#x2013; the way to Easy Pass is anything but easy. But the reward for your efforts is an eastside gateway into the stunning North Cascades National Park. At the pass, you&#x2019;re greeted by trickling streams of snowmelt and views of the peaks of Golden Horn and Mount Henry to the east. Venturing further west, gaze into the park, with awe-inspiring glacially carved river valleys, the dark gray craggy massifs of Fisher Peak and Mount Logan dotted with snowfields or cloaked by glaciers, and a host of wildflowers. <br><br>Set off from the trailhead just off of Highway 20, immediately entering forested lowlands. Cross a creek on a large log bridge, complete with a stairstep approach and a handrail for safety while crossing wide, silty Granite Creek. Note how close you are to the trailhead; you may want to take a dip in the creek on the way back to your car, particularly if the day is hot. <br>Continue through rolling forest, surrounded by queens cup, vanilla leaf, and other flora sprinkled among the trunks of cedars and pines. The trail takes you up and down through this landscape, but generally gains elevation for about a mile and a half. <br><br>Arrive at a creek crossing spanned by several logs not very securely set across the stream. This is Easy Pass Creek and in spring, it can run high. Have your trekking poles at the ready &#x2013; they are invaluable in getting safely across. But if the water is running high, consider making this your turnaround point and trying for the pass another time. <br><br>Cross Easy Pass Creek and leave the forest behind. Now you&#x2019;re hiking along the floor of a valley, in a wide, rocky alpine meadow. From here on, the hike is exposed, with very few opportunities for shade, so slather on some sunscreen and proceed through the valley. Two passes are in evidence here &#x2013; Easy Pass is the one directly in front of you, with a large rocky peak to the north. Many a hiker has exclaimed, &#x201C;That can&#x2019;t be it, it looks too easy!&#x201D; Don&#x2019;t be fooled. It&#x2019;s still quite a climb. <br><br>A the head of the valley, re-enter forest for a short while. After a couple of switchbacks through welcome shade, re-cross Easy Pass Creek (this time it&#x2019;s a much more secure crossing) and begin switchbacking up a steep talus slope. Easy Pass is on a fault line, so the talus frequently slides, and WTA work parties clear trail here over the summer, moving tons of loose rock to re-establish the trail. <br><br>Continue through a lush green section of the trail, with Easy Pass Creek always within earshot, if not visible. Consider refilling your water bottle here the next time you see the creek. There is no more reliable water source until the pass; only about a mile away, but a very steep, exposed mile. And in late summer, if the snow is melted, there may be no water at all at the pass. <br><br>Climb up several switchbacks into a hanging valley. Now comes the final push. The trail carries you along the edge of the meadow, with a rocky boulder field on your left. Gradually leave the greenery for the rocks as you hike ever higher to the pass. Here too, WTA work parties have improved trail, installing rock steps and recarving the trail that leads to your destination. <br>Throw down your pack and have a drink of water. Maybe reapply some sunscreen, and grab your camera. The views in every direction are spectacular and will keep you occupied for a long rest. Explore the pass in every direction, and then head back the way you came. The way down is easier than the way up. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Incorporate Easy Pass into a fall &#x201C;Larch March&#x201D;. Take a long weekend and head to the North Cascades, an area chock-full of hikes lined by larches, which turn an arresting gold in the autumn.</p>\n                 ",

The PCT here is wide and ascends at a moderate grade through forest. If you start in the afternoon, a nice campsite can be found below Cutthroat Pass at about four miles. From the camp, switchbacks take you to Cutthroat Pass at 6800 feet. The pass is five miles from the trailhead and makes a nice turn-around point for a day hike.

After about 1.25 miles, a trail branches left to Lake Ann, a jewel cradled in a talus bowl, a glacial cirque created in eons past. The detour is a relatively flat 0.6 miles round trip and well-worth it. Stopping by the shore of Lake Ann affords you a view of the pass that you&apos;re headed to. Be sure to note the forces of glaciation and landslides which have created it and the large island within it.<br><br>Back on the main trail, you&apos;ll traverse above Lake Ann, traversing through swathes of wildflowers before reaching Heather Pass, about three-quarters of a mile past the Lake Ann turnoff. From Heather Pass there are social trails which meander through meadows to the north. These are routes that cross-country hikers and climbers use to visit Lewis and Wing Lakes, Black Peak, and beyond. But views from the trail itself are stunning enough.<br><br>Now redirect yourself, following the trail as it heads left on the ridgeline and continue upward towards Maple Pass. Note that this section of the trail crosses a steep hillside that can retain snow until late in the season.  <br><br>Gaining the ridge, the edge of the North Cascades National Park is evident by prominent park signs. Wander, gaze, luxuriate, and thrill at the views, both at your feet and off to the horizon. Watch for ptarmigans and their young roosts. Nearby mountains include Corteo, Frisco, Goode, Stiletto, Black Peak and many more. A bit more distant is the stately Liberty Bell group beckoning. And then past that, a sea of peaks stretches out in every direction as far as your imagination can hike. <br><br>All too soon this glorious loop starts switch-backing downwards. Luckily, the views  continue unabated. The trail picks up speed through the forest. The last 2.5 miles drops about 1700 feet on pretty sound tread. When the trail finally pops out onto a paved ADA-accessible path, turn left and you&#x2019;ve got just one half mile to your car.<br><br>If you decide to hike the trail heading clockwise, set out from the southern end of the parking lot, along a paved trail which travels the trail that also leads to Rainy Lake, a nice detour or alternate destination for those with a group of varying hiking abilities. One-half mile along this trail, arrive at a fork and take the right branch, turning uphill. Continuing straight would take you another 0.6 miles to Rainy Lake.<br><br>From the fork, hike uphill along your first switchback. The way is quite gradual, but gains elevation steadily through avalanche paths and mature woods. Continue climbing as you switchback a few times through hillsides awash in penstemon, Indian paintbrush, monkeyflower, sitka valerian and more, until you arrive in Maple Pass, with its stunning views of Black Peak and North Cascades National Park. Your descent is more gradual, sweeping along the loop as it arcs east, down to the junction with Lake Ann. <br><br>If you&apos;ve got time, take the detour for Lake Ann. If not, the parking lot is a little more than a mile further on.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: One can debate the merits of hiking this loop either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Going clockwise, one reaps the benefit of getting the steep part of the trail out of the way early in the day and a more gradual descent at day&#x2019;s end, while a counter-clockwise hike offers ever more dramatic views of Black Peak and the North Cascades National Park as you climb to the pass.

But when conditions are good, the physical exertion needed to tromp up this steep-sloped peak is richly rewarded with stunning views of the jagged crests of a multitude of North Cascade peaks. Glacier Peak dominates the horizon to the southeast, but the landscape closer at hand is just as lovely. Because of the frequent, frigid winds, the vegetation of exposed meadows on the upper slopes of Sauk is usually glazed with frilly ice lacing. Hoarfrost, formed by wind-driven moisture and cold air temperatures, creates delicate icy ornamentation on limbs, leaves, and--when they stand still too long--snowshoers.<br><br>After turning around and parking well off the main road, continue up the roadway on snowshoes. The road repeatedly switchbacks as it climbs relentlessly for another mile through open clearcut meadows and thin patches of second-growth forest. The road continues to climb, now in heavy second-growth timber, until, near the 4-mile mark, views reveal stunning peeks down into the perpetually mist-laden Sauk River valley and southwest toward Glacier Peak. <br><br>Keep hiking along the windswept road as it rolls along the flank of Sauk Mountain to a final switchback corner at about 4.5 miles.

If it has just melted, notice the glacier lilies and spring beauty left in its wake. Circle around the north side and there will be an intersecting trail to the right leading downhill. This leads to Sauk Lake, losing more elevation than you gained from the parking lot.  There will be little trails leading over the ridge to viewpoints, but stay on the main trail, as you want the Big Picture at the top.<br><br>Swing around the hill and come to a flat spot by a nice grove of trees. Look over the edge and see Sauk Lake. From here the trail to the top will be visible below the rock pinnacles. Early in the season, this section of the trail may be covered with snowfields. Cross carefully, or enjoy your lunch from the trees and save the rest for later. If the snow is gone, follow the trail through the rocks. Notice the small alpine flowers, saxifrage, potentilla, thyme buckwheat and yellow coralbells. Clinging to the rocks is a large shrubby grey-leafed plant with odd looking creamy flower clusters called silverback luina. <br><br>The trail can be a little hard to follow at the top, but look for worn tread in a saddle between the rocks, cross over and make your way to the lookout site at the top. Soak in the views and try to name all the peaks, a sea of peaks, near and far. The Pickets are obvious, as is Whitehorse Mountain near Darrington, Glacier Peak and over to the south, Rainier. You may see Mount Constitution on Orcas Island. There once was a fire lookout here and you can still see some debris from it at the summit. On a nice sunny weekend it can get crowded up here, so eat your lunch, take your pictures and head down so someone else can enjoy it.<br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: Use the National Geographic North Cascades National Park map for peak identification from the summit; it covers more of this territory than Green Trails.</p>\n                 ",

While the occasional skier may struggle up the narrow trail, the route is mostly ignored simply because so many other trails are better suited to their long skis. Snowshoes, though, make easy work of this trail, climbing gently as it does through deep, dry-side forests to end at the site of a pretty little waterfall.

The trail is easy to follow even in heavy snow, although it is slow going at times as the route weaves up and down, in and out of tree wells. At 1.8 miles out, the trail angles down toward the creek and the last mile is right alongside the waterway.

In the warmer months, try the circumnavigation of Sherman Peak plus the bonus excursion out to picturesque Snow Peak cabin. Plan ahead and rent the cabin, which is reservable for $30 per night for up to six people, year-round. <br><br>Camping here is hardly roughing it, as the cabin rental comes complete with wood stove, firewood supply, cots, table, propane cook stove, basic cookware, and solar lighting. Bring your own food and water, but otherwise, a visit to Snow Peak Cabin is where glamping meets backpacking. <br><br>Since the parking lot at the top of Sherman Pass is less than a quarter-mile north of Highway 20, trailhead access couldn&apos;t be easier. A SnoPark permit is required in the winter and funds the snow removal that makes year-round access possible at this highest mountain pass in Washington state. No permit is required for summer access.<br><br>Begin the hike by crossing Highway 20, as the parking lot is on the north side of the pass, but the trail to Snow Peak cabin is on the south side. From the pass, elevation 5,574 feet, begin to climb a series of switchbacks up the northern flank of Sherman Peak on the Kettle Crest South Trail. After approximately one mile, reach the intersection of the Kettle Crest (due east) and the Sherman Peak Loop Trail (due west), as well as a reliable spring. During the warmer months of the year, stay on the Kettle Crest at this junction for the best views of the aftermath of the 1988 White Mountain Fire, noting that the return is via the Sherman Peak Loop. <br><br>For winter visitors, snow levels and steep slopes make an out-and-back via the Loop trail a better alternative, but be sure to take note of avalanche conditions before you go and carry necessary snow travel equipment. <br><br>When the two trails reconverge on the south side of Sherman Peak, continue south on the Kettle Crest trail. The trail skirts Snow Peak on its way to the cabin; the pyramid-shaped peak to the right is Bald Mountain. At approximately the five-mile mark, watch for a small spring on the left and the spur trail to the cabin on the right. The spring is the only water source, so be sure to pack a filter. <br><br>The cabin makes an excellent final destination on this trail, but the adventurous can use it as a jumping off point for further exploration. The Kettle Crest Trail continues to its southern terminus approximately 7 miles distance, passing Barnaby Butte and White Mountain en-route. Approximately one mile south of Snow Peak Cabin on the Kettle Crest, watch for intersecting Edds Mountain Trail (#3) which contours around both Bald and Edds Mountains on a seldom-used trail.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Plan ahead, especially if you&apos;d like to book the cabin on a weekend. According to the Colville National Forest website, reservations must be made at least two days in advance. The longest length stay is five consecutive nights. Phone 1-877-444-6777 or visit www.recreation.gov for more information about cabin rentals.</p>\n                 ",

The forest soon thins, offering glimpses to the jumbled array of peaks across the Skagit Valley.<br><br>Just after 2 miles the trail briefly drops to traverse a dank mossy hollow supporting a handful of mammoth cedars, and then the trail picks up the pace again. Lighter tread and a few gullied sections help keep your pace in check. After passing a series of boulders and overhanging ledges, the trail enters a grove of impressive old growth.<br><br>Eventually the forest thins, yellow cedars and subalpine firs indicating that much elevation has thus far been gained. After 4 miles and at about 4000 feet, finally break out of the canopy. Views begin to unravel across huckleberry-choked slopes that were scorched many decades ago by wildfire. Continue across the brushy terrain, coming to a small meadow with a small tarn.<br><br>For better panoramic viewing, find a faint path heading northwest up an open rib. Here in the heart of Cow Heaven, steak your viewing spot! The deep U-shaped Skagit Valley unfurls below you. Craggy Colonial Peak and the Teebone Ridge (seriously) tower above it. Jack is the big guy on the western horizon. The Newhalem powerhouse is the big structure below. Turn south to take in a sweeping view of the Cascade River valley.

    "desc": "\n                    <p>&#x201C;The view we enjoyed from the summit could hardly be surpassed in sublimity and grandeur; but one feels far from home so high in the sky, so much so that one is inclined to guess that, apart from the acquisition of knowledge and the exhilaration of climbing, more pleasure is to be found at the foot of the mountains than on their tops.&#x201D;<br><br>So offered naturalist John Muir after climbing Mount Rainier, and for peaks like Rainier &#x2013; desolate and remote &#x2013; he has a point; but Hidden Lake Peak proves precisely the opposite. Offer the exhilaration of climbing it certainly does, proceeding well above the treeline to a summit that hardly looks attainable from a distance; but it also offers an intimate view of the very heart of the North Cascades, the kind of immersive experience not available by gazing up from the valleys below. From wildflower meadows in its early stretches to stark granite at the top, it is a front row seat for all that draws us upward.<br><br>The contrast between the start of the trail and the end could not be greater. The path to the Hidden Lake Lookout starts out in dense forest along and occasionally through and over runoff streams. After about a mile, the trail emerges into the open below soaring cliffs and ridges in a deep creek drainage. Shortly after, it crosses the east fork of Sibley Creek for the first of two times and begins switchbacking over badly eroded tread through fields of false hellebore, slide alder, and&#x2013;unfortunately&#x2013;stinging nettles. Soon, though, the unruly undergrowth fades to meadows of wildflowers, in early summer it delivers a stunning display in both color and variety. Roughly a mile from the prior creek crossing, the trail makes it second hop over Sibley Creek. <br><br>Here the terrain undergoes yet another radical transformation. For the next three quarters of a mile, you make your mostly level way across a rocky slope filled with heather and blueberries. In fall, this may be the very best place in the Cascades to find highly prized vaccinium deliciosum, the most flavorful of all mountain blueberries. Meanwhile, the giants of the North Cascades come into view. The sheer western face of Eldorado Peak&#x2019;s perfect pyramid peers over the headwaters of Sibley Creek. In the other direction, Mount Baker and Mount Shuksan hover above the ridge of Big Devil Peak. <br><br>At the end of this stretch, the trail swings to the south. Snow lingers late, and even at the end of summer, the gully the trail climbs through may well hold patches of snow. The surroundings change dramatically yet again, with the trees and subalpine meadows giving way to bare granite. In a quarter of a mile, you see the lookout for the first time. It looks menacingly unattainable, perched next to broken rock that seems to reach for the sky in a giant claw at the top of a near-vertical face. To the south, the smooth glaciers of Snowking Mountain make a brief appearance. <br><br>In another quarter of a mile, you reach a high saddle that marks the boundary of North Cascades National Park. If the view here doesn&#x2019;t take your breath away, check for a pulse: the dark waters of Hidden Lake seem to disappear over the lip of a hanging valley beyond which stand some of the staunchest sentinels of the North Cascades &#x2013; Johannesburg Peak, Sahale Mountain, Boston Peak, and Mount Forbidden. <br><br>From here, the trail is much more informal. It traverses to the right over a steep open slope beneath the summit, intersecting the visible ridgeline about halfway up its length. There the route heads right over jumbled boulders. You may be able to pick out a smoother bootpack in the dirt and follow it until reaching the summit lookout. As you would expect from someplace once used for spotting wildfires, 360-degree views of an immense area now open up around you.  <br><br>What makes the view so remarkable is the extent to which the long ridge containing the most storied mountaineering prizes of the North Cascades is laid out like a ribbon in front of your eyes. Seldom are hikers surrounded by so many mighty mountains in one spot: Sahale, Triad, Eldorado, Torment, Boston, Forbidden, Klawatti, Sharkfin. From here, you can see just how closely one stacks on top of the next after the next. <br><br>Not to be overlooked is the lookout itself, a living museum and relic of the network of such structures that once numbered in the hundreds, strung out across the state. <br><br>There are many mountaintops where the only traces of the lookouts that once stood upon them are some rusty nails, burnt timbers, and broken glass. Ascend to the summit of Crater Peak or Mount Pugh, and that is all you&#x2019;ll find there; but here, the lookout endures, despite having been retired from service many decades ago. It speaks both to the durability of its construction and the commitment of the individuals who have given so much to preserve it. <br><br>Built in 1932, the Hidden Lake Lookout was decommissioned by the Forest Service sometime around 1953. In 1960, the Skagit Alpine Club secured a special use permit to renovate and maintain it for club activities, but by 1980, the club had turned its attention to the Park Butte Lookout instead. <br><br>One of SAC&#x2019;s members, however, wasn&#x2019;t ready to let Hidden Lake Lookout go. Dr. Fred Darvill formed a group called the Friends of Hidden Lake Lookout under the auspices of the Skagit Environmental Council and took over responsibility for its maintenance. <br><br>Many people think of the lookout as a camping shelter, and it is in fact available on a first-come, first-serve basis; but Dr. Darvill intended its preservation mostly for historical purposes. Darvill, who passed away in late 2007, is a somewhat under-recognized figure in the history of the outdoors in Washington. He was an authority in backcountry first aid and was an effective advocate for wilderness, playing an instrumental role in the creation of the North Cascades National Park. It&#x2019;s altogether fitting that this spot, looking out over the park, has become such a visible legacy of his work.<br><br>As he became less able to visit the lookout, his role as chief steward passed to Robert Kendall. On a jaunt up here, you may very well run into Robert on one of his work parties at the lookout. If you see him, be sure to say thanks for the work he does (or offer to help!), and if you stay in the lookout, be sure to donate what you can to help cover supplies (there&#x2019;s a rough guideline of $15-$25/night). <br><br>Ironically, the lookout has now stood as a historic monument longer than it served its original function as a fire lookout. In 1987, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. <br><br>This place&#x2013;the intersection of so much incredible terrain and history&#x2013;is one of the most remarkable hiking destinations in all of the Cascades; and while it may not be quite as immediately scenic as spots like the Enchantments or Sahale Arm, it holds a special allure that is very hard to overstate.  <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: While no special permit is required to stay in the lookout (which sits just outside the park boundary), camping at Hidden Lake (or anywhere between the lake and the ridge line) requires a backcountry permit available at the ranger station in Marblemount. There is no trail from the saddle to the lake, so be prepared to clamber over boulders as you find your route. Don&#x2019;t camp on the shores of the lake or other nearby tarns &#x2013; the landscape here is quite fragile. Look for bare dirt or established sites. Campfires are not permitted.</p>\n                 ",

Amble along this protruding point in Lopez Sound watching for playful seals, probing shorebirds, surf-riding waterfowl, and majestic eagles hovering above. The hike is short, but you&apos;ll want to linger long, for Spencer Spit is one of the finest beaches in the San Juans.<br><br>It&apos;s a short jaunt to the beach, and all downhill. Immediately upon leaving the trailhead, come to a junction. Turn right and make a beeline straight for the picnic area at the base of the spit. Homesteaded in the 1880s by the Spencer and Troxell families, the area is still graced with fruit trees and other remnants of their tenure. Passive bunnies also abound. Be careful not to twist an ankle in one of their burrows. It can be a hare-oing experience! In 1967 the spit and adjacent uplands, 138 acres in all, were transferred to Washington State Parks.<br><br>Time to explore the spit. If the tide is high, stick to the wide trail; otherwise, scamper over a hedgerow of beached logs to the beach. It&apos;s a 0.4-mile glorious walk to the tip of the spit, where Frost Island teasingly tempts to be touched. If the spit ever expands enough to embrace the island, a land formation known as a tombolo will be created. The channel separating these two landforms, however, is deep and swift moving, so the likelihood of this happening is not great.<br><br>Check out the log cabin at the tip of the spit. A 1978 replica of a 1913 structure, it was constructed of driftwood logs. Now return via the north shore of the spit. Watch for playful harbor seals and water-plying ferries. Scan Flower Island for avian activity. Admire a beautiful backdrop dominated by Orcas Island&apos;s Mount Constitution.<br><br>At 0.25 mile from the cabin, come to a creek draining the spit&apos;s interior lagoon. Expect wet feet crossing the creek. Don&apos;t enter the lagoon; it&apos;s a sanctuary for breeding, nesting, and feeding birds. Continue along the beach another 0.25 mile, coming to a walk-in campground. Turn south, following a lagoon-hugging trail back to the picnic area and then back to your vehicle.

The route meanders back and forth between the Skagit River and the highway, sometimes closer to the river, other times right next to the highway, but always with scenic views of farmland and foothills. In winter one can see tundra swans and snow geese poking about in the fields. Near Lyman, the trail hugs the banks of the Skagit before the river begins a southerly meander.

This up-and-down trail covers 21 miles with a cumulative elevation gain of almost 4,300 feet round-trip. Your reward for the effort is magnificent Gardner Meadows, a prairie-like valley set between towering peaks and jagged ridges. <br><br>What makes Gardner Meadows so magical is its park-like setting and the amazing diversity of life within it. The trail rolls into the meadows over gentle grassy hills dotted with old growth fir. Mountains and dramatic ridges ring the valley on three sides. To the north, the rocky slopes of Mount Gardner seem to lean over you. To the southwest, Abernathy Peak rises high into the sky. Immediately to the south, the teeth of a folded ridge gnaw at the horizon. <br><br>Throughout the meadows, Columbian ground squirrels scatter at your approaching footsteps, whistling warnings as they dive into their innumerable burrows. Deer wander down into the meadows at dusk and back up the hillsides at dawn. Signs of cat (perhaps lynx, perhaps something larger) abound. Across the rushing waters of Wolf Creek come the yips of coyotes (or perhaps wolves &#x2013; from a distance, it&#x2019;s hard to tell the difference). Bluebirds, owls and juncos may shadow you along the trail. <br><br>In late spring, nearly every wildflower imaginable explodes from everywhere &#x2013; arrowleaf balsamroot, shooting stars, lupine, avalanche lilies, alpine strawberries, and wild rose, among others too numerous to name. <br><br>The trail starts by losing 250 feet in elevation (which of course means you re-gain that same elevation on your weary way out). Shortly thereafter, it enters the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness. At 2.6 miles, you cross the North Fork of Wolf Creek by way of a sturdy log bridge. At 3.7 miles, the trail traverses a slope of basalt that has crumbled to black sand. After that, it is a long march, devoid of major distinguishing features. <br><br>There are a few camping spots along the way. Just after the crossing of the North Fork of Wolf Creek, a large meadow offers several places to pitch a tent, but this only takes you three miles towards your destination. A single camp site is available at 5.4 miles. There are several places to camp at the junction with the Abernathy Lake trail at 7.6 miles. <br><br>Not long after the trail junction, you begin to leave the trees as you head into an area blackened by fire some time ago (judging by the size of the new growth, at least a decade past). As you close in on the meadows, you pass through a grove of aspen, seemingly out of place in this otherwise coniferous landscape. <br><br>And then you arrive. From here, you have several options. Sit out on one of the large rocks or fallen trees and simply soak it all in. Follow the trail across Wolf Creek to its very end in a long abandoned mining claim. Find a spot in the trees to camp &#x2013; there are several flat spots that make good sites. For the ambitious, an arduous climb to the summit of Gardner or North Gardner Mountain beckons. <br><br>No matter what you do, remember &#x2013; it&#x2019;s more than ten miles back to your car!</p>\n                 ",

Originally a pond, the lake was dammed in the early 1900s (you&apos;ll cross over the dam at the north end of the lake).

Instead, take the road down to Bowman Bay for some fine hiking along the rugged cliffs. Great views of the bridge over Deception and Canoe Pass, calm Lottie Bay, a woodland walk through hemlock, fir and Pacific Madrone, plus the legend of the Maiden of Deception Pass are what await you here.<br><br>Begin your journey by walking out on the fishing pier to see what people are catching and snap a few pictures of the seagulls hanging around hoping for a handout. Unless you have a line in the water, walk back and head south along the shore of Bowman Bay to the trail to Lottie and Lighthouse Point. Pick up the trail as it crosses over a marshy area and up a small steep rocky cliff.  Drop down to sea level and come to a signed intersection. Left takes you up to Highway 20 and Pass Lake, but you&apos;ll hang a right and shortly come to another intersection. <br><br>Head left here and follow the trail around Lottie Point. Take this trail for views of Deception and Canoe Pass and the impressive bridge above. Admire also the beautiful red peeling bark and twisted trunks of the Pacific Madrone trees along the cliffs. This striking native broadleaf evergreen has clusters of tiny white flowers in the spring and showy orangey red berries in the fall. It prefers a sunny dry and rocky site and grows along the rugged coastal cliffs of Puget Sound. Once you have done this short half-mile loop, meet the trail to Lighthouse Point at the intersection again. <br><br>The trail to Lighthouse Point crosses a very narrow sliver of grassy beach. Here you may want to dig out your binoculars and check out whatever ducks may be on the calm waters of Lottie Bay. The trail forks by a large hollowed-out, burned tree. Take the left fork for a nice mile-long loop around the point.  Surprisingly, for such as small area, there are some nice old Douglas firs here. Walk through the woods a short way and come to more views of the bridge and across to Whidbey Island and North Beach. At one point you will be able to drop down to the beach and climb up a large grassy rock outcropping. Look for the geological survey marker, marking it as Lighthouse Point, elevation just about 22 feet. <br><br>Feel winded? Pull out those binoculars and watch for harbor seals that like to swim offshore. When you&apos;ve got your breath back, continue on to Vista Point. Here the trail fades off into a bunch of little paths through the salal and Oregon grape, go back and catch the obvious trail for the loop, or explore a little and head back to the main trail when ready. <br><br>Once back at the fishing pier, continue past the parking lot, through the picnic area and past the CCC Interpretive center and you will find the trail to your last destination, Rosario Beach. Start off with a short, steep little climb, then level off as you head above the bay. There are plenty of paths leading to scenic overlooks. Notice Gull Rocks just offshore; they should be named Cormorant Corners, since there seem to be more cormorants than seagulls!  <br><br>Reach Rosario Beach picnic area in a half-mile. If you hike this in winter, no that the park here will be officially closed, and the restrooms will be locked. There are picnic tables along the narrow stretch of land between the parking lot and Rosario Head. Here you will find a large pole carving of Kwuh-kwal-uhl-wut, the Maiden of Deception Pass. A legend of the Coast Salish people, take the time to read her story on plaques which circle the pole, along with some facts about the Native people that called this place home. <br><br>Take the loop trail around Rosario Head, but be careful of the steep drop off along the cliffs. Keep children and dogs away from the edges. Here there are more expansive views out across the Sound to the Olympics. If you are camping nearby, remember this place for some sunset photography or a little romantic picnic. Once you have completed the circle, head back the way you came with a full pack of scenery.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: To extend your hike, hike to Pass Lake, then walk along the highway and across the bridge for hikes up Goose Rock or down to the North Beach.</p>\n                 ",

In 0.25 mile, near a handsome tree, come to a junction with Trail No.320. This hiker-only trail heads to Heart Lake, one of the nicest natural features in the community forest lands. You, however, are heading to Sugarloaf, so bear right and continue on Trail No. 215.<br><br>The warm-up is over. The path now changes gears, shifting into a steep climb. Doug-firs replace cedars. Ferns and moss line the way. At 0.5 mile, encounter another junction, where you stay to the right on Trail No. 215. Under a canopy of mature Douglas-firs, the trail wastes little time reaching the summit block, working its way up and around a series of mossy ledges. At 1 mile is another trail junction. Turn left, leaving Trail No. 215 for Trail No. 226. One final short push and you&apos;re on top of the 1044-foot loaf. But, where are those sweet views that were promised? Head to the right down Trail No. 238 (it loops from Trail No. 226), and in five minutes you&apos;ll be staring out over Whidbey, Vancouver, and the San Juan islands. Enjoy views, too, out to the Cascades from this shelf of sun-kissed grassy ledges. The big blob in front of you is Mount Erie, highest point on Fidalgo Island. The views from that 1273-foot peak are indeed fine, but its summit road may leave a bad taste in your mouth. Savor instead the sweet scenic serenity of Sugarloaf.\n                 ",

From the high peaks on either side of the pass, verdant meadows curve down to a saddle that offers sweeping views of nearby valleys, glaciers, mountains, and passing wildlife. Sedately climbing a little less than 1,800 feet in 3.6 miles, it is the perfect hike to show new hikers the extraordinary places their feet can take them. <br><br>The epic scenery begins before you even hit the trail. The unpaved section of Cascade River Road skirts massive old growth trees on the way to the circular parking lot tucked underneath Johannesburg Mountain, towering more than 4,000 feet overhead. <br><br>As you travel through the 30-some switchbacks that define the first 2.7 miles of trail, Johannesburg (a malapropism of the nearby Johnsberg mining claim) continues to make its presence felt, even when barely visible through the trees. On warm days, snow and ice from its hanging glaciers break loose and boom down the mountainside. <br><br>Once you round the final switchback, you have one mile to go, proceeding more or less straight for the pass. The trees grow steadily thinner as you reach open slopes and the pass comes into view. After crossing a long rockfield, the trail makes a few final bends and arrives at the pass, where a post marked for Stehekin points the way into the lush valley below. But don&apos;t be fooled -- the little community of Stehekin lies at the head of Lake Chelan, nearly thirty miles from where you currently stand.<br><br>Cascade Pass offers views of several impressive peaks and glaciers. The ridge from Johannesburg Mountain connects to Mixup Peak and Magic Mountain, in between which lies the Cache Glacier. Back the way you came, the horizon is comprised largely of the glacier-dotted lower slopes and snowy summit ar&#xEA;te of El Dorado Peak. <br><br>Nearer by, you may very well be treated to views of wildlife. In addition to the local population of marmots and pika, the occasional deer, mountain goat, or bear may wander through on the way to and from steeper, rockier places or the wildflower and blueberry fields just above and beyond the pass. <br><br>We humans have likewise been using Cascade Pass as a crossroads for thousands of years, and today it is still not at all the end of the trail. From here, the trail to Stehekin continues east through the abandoned mining claims of Horseshoe Basin. To the north, a trail continues to Sahale Arm. To the south, a backcountry high route known as the Ptarmigan Traverse marches up the slopes of Mixup Peak and disappears over the ridge. <br><br>One trip here, though, and you may rightfully conclude that it is a spectacular destination in its own right. <br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: Only you can fight chipmunk obesity! The steady stream of visitors to the pass has created a population of corpulent chipmunks. Respect Leave No Trace principles and guard your crumbs jealously to help the chipmunks return to a more natural diet.</p>\n                 ",

Instead, a scenic trail ambles peacefully through rolling alpine meadows blanketing the broad shoulder of Sahale Mountain. This park-like setting is made all the more spectacular by contrast with the dramatic mountainous terrain that stretches off in every direction near and far. <br><br>Begin by following the Cascade Pass trail. From Cascade Pass, the trail heads north (left when arriving at the pass) and switchbacks its way up a steep slope. In early summer, it is a sea of glacier lilies; in fall, it is covered in mountain blueberries. In amongst the shrubs and wildflowers here, a population of marmots-unofficial ambassadors of Sahale Arm&#x2013;begin a welcome that continues for much of the hike. Lumbering through the meadows, they seem not only unconcerned by the hikers passing through, but intent on entertaining them. <br><br>Approximately three quarters of a mile from Cascade Pass, the trail crests a rounded shoulder at 6,000 feet in elevation and emerges suddenly to an awesome sight: Sahale Mountain and its eponymous glacier. Shimmering silver ribbons of meltwater snake their way down the precipitous slopes of the mountain some 3,000 feet to Doubtful Lake, tucked just out of sight. <br><br>The trail heads left, offering peeks at Doubtful Lake below. The next fifth of a mile is mostly flat, a gentle stroll through heather before turning right towards Sahale Mountain. Though seeming to make its way gradually through small groves of trees, the trail climbs quite steeply around the bend before once again attaining the ridge. To the left, views open up to the unforgiving terrain of Boston Basin. Peaks with names like &#x201C;Forbidden&#x201D; and &#x201C;Torment&#x201D; tower above the Quien Sabe (&#x201C;Who Knows&#x201D;) Glacier. Further off in the distance, Mount Baker, Shuksan and Eldorado dot the skyline. <br><br>After another half mile, the trail once again levels out as it passes the occasional tarn and outcroppings of granite set amongst windblown grass. You could be forgiven for feeling as if you&#x2019;ve been transplanted to the Scottish Highlands. <br><br>Enjoy this section while it lasts. In another fifth of a mile, the trail pitches upward again through a rutted, muddy section along a quietly cascading stream. The trail doesn&#x2019;t let up again until it reaches the Sahale Glacier Camp, a collection of flat spots ringed with rocks piled up against the wind. The final half mile climbs sharply over scree and rock.<br><br>Some of the campsites sit on the very edge of the terminal moraine of the glacier. The views are simply amazing. From here, you can see beyond the peaks of Cascade Pass to an endless procession of mountains such as Formidable and Spider. To the east, Sahale connects to Buckner Mountain, and beyond sit Storm King and Goode, the tallest summit in North Cascades National Park. In fall, Sahale Arm itself is the best part of the vista, as the meadows turn a brilliant shade of rust-red. <br><br>As if there weren&#x2019;t enough to draw you here already, Sahale Arm is also a reliable place to spot bear. An impressively large black bear with a glossy coat has been repeatedly spotted meandering across Sahale Arm and occasionally down to Cascade Pass. <br><br>The bear knows what many a hiker does as well: of all the many incredible places in the North Cascades, this may very well be the finest to wander through. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Camping in the Sahale Glacier Camp requires a backcountry permit, available on a first-come, first-served basis at the ranger station in Marblemount.</p>\n                 ",

Over the course of its 44 miles, it presents a virtual highlight reel of dry-side beauty, from sage-scented meadows to subalpine parkland.<br><br>Located in the far northeast corner of the state, the Kettle Crest features a half-dozen of Eastern Washington&#x2019;s highest peaks, some topping out at more than 7,000 feet. Nominally a ridge-running route, the Kettle Crest tallies up nearly 8,000 feet of cumulative elevation gain over its length. Yet there are no cloud-piercing spires here, just a mosaic of old-growth forests and open sagebrush meadows, from which shimmer distant vistas of the Cascade and Rocky Mountains.<br><br>Owing to its diversity of habitats and lack of human development, the Kettle Range boasts some of the best remaining wildlife habitat in Eastern Washington. Hikers should keep their eyes peeled for cougar, moose, mule deer and black bear, all cruising the high country. But in summer, the dazzling array of wildflowers&#x2014;buckwheat, lupine, aster, yarrow, paintbrush, hawkweed and others&#x2014;will likely keep your attention focused on the foreground.<br><br>From the southern trailhead, ascend through profuse wildflowers on White Mountain before beginning a view-packed stretch past Barnaby Buttes and Bald Mountain. The southwest slope of Snow Peak holds great camp spots near the shelter. Skirt Sherman Peak and Columbia Mountain, then traipse along a sagebrush lined ridge; camp sites are scattered along the way. The high point is 7,140-foot Copper Butte, where fragments of an old lookout remain. <br><br>Descend through a ghost forest of snags and settle in for open grasslands and lupine-filled fir forest, all the way to the northern trailhead at Boulder Pass. This is one of the sections of the trail that creep under ghostly silver snags left standing from past wildfires, most notably the 1988 White Mountain Fire, which scorched more than 20,000 acres of the southern Kettles. In these sections, wildlife, wildflowers and wide-open views have taken the place of the trees, making this one of the scenic highlights of the region.<br><br>Aside from a few wooded saddles, virtually the entire route offers up big views: to the south, the Colville Indian Reservation and northernmost reaches of the Columbia Plateau; to the west, the Okanogan Highlands and, beyond, the Cascades; to the north, the peaks of British Columbia; and to the east, Idaho&#x2019;s Selkirks.<br><br>To the Colville tribe, whose ancestral lands encompassed the Kettle Range, the mountains bear sacred significance. On White Mountain, near the southern terminus of the trail, hikers can inspect cairns built by young members of the tribe during vision quests. Subsequent generations of visitors have also fallen under the spell of the Kettles, and a dedicated group of local conservationists has spent the last 40 years pressing for a congressional designation of wilderness for the Kettle Crest.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Tapped springs, never more than a half-dozen miles apart, can hydrate hikers who plan refills carefully. Keep in mind this is open rangeland, and cattle congregate around the springs, some of which have been maintained in less-than stellar fashion by grazing leaseholders. Filter all your water.</p>\n                 ",

And in addition to the profuse birdlife, you&apos;ll be treated to unhindered views of surrounding mountains, islands, and farmland from this delightful and level path.<br><br>Begin by walking back down Second Street and then Bay View-Edison Road for 0.15 mile to the Padilla Bay shore trailhead. Roads are lightly traveled, but keep children and dogs close by. The short drop in elevation from parking lot to trailhead is the only elevation change you&apos;ll experience on this hike. Relax and enjoy this perfectly level trail for the next 2.25 miles.<br><br>Developed in 1990 by a consortium of public agencies, the Padilla Bay Shore Trail allows the best pedestrian viewings of the estuarine reserve. Established for research, education, and stewardship, Padilla is one of only twenty-seven such reserves in the country. Padilla harbors some of the best remaining eelgrass flats north of Willapa Bay, but the area has been heavily influenced by agriculture and industry. Farmers have reclaimed thousands of acres of tideflats for cropland, and a large oil refinery sits across the bay at March Point.<br><br>But the area still remains ecologically viable and incredibly scenic, especially during low tide, when nearly the entire 8-by-3-mile bay is transformed into glistening mudflats and slithering sloughs. Hordes of herons harvesting succulent appetizers can often be observed. Be sure to cast your attention to the neighboring &quot;drier&quot;grounds for songbird and raptor sightings.<br><br>If bird-watching doesn&apos;t ruffle your feathers, the surrounding scenery should still tickle your fancy. Islands dot the bay, with Lummi and the San Juans guarding its northern waters. Across Padilla, the conifer-cloaked knolls of Sugarloaf and Mount Erie crown Fildalgo Island. Mount Baker rises above the countryside to the east, and to the south Mount Rainier hovers in the distance over the Skagit Flats.<br><br>In 1.8 miles you&apos;ll approach a lone cedar and a slough-side barn, a favorite among photographers casual and serious alike. The trail then turns away from the mudflats, following a snaking Indian Slough for a final 0.5 mile and terminating at its southern trailhead. From this alternative starting area (where parking is limited), begin your return, enjoying a new phase of the bay.\n                 ",

Following an old prospector&apos;s path first through lush forest then across sun-kissed slopes flush in floral splendor, the way isn&apos;t easy but it has its rewards. From the lofty pass enjoy up-close and personal views of some of the North Cascades more distinguished peaks. To the north Liberty Bell Mountain rings out, while Stiletto Peak sticks out like a knife in the south. Visit in fall and watch Copper turn to gold thanks to the larches.<br><br>Three worthy trails disperse from this trailhead. Take the one heading west, Twisp Pass Trail No. 432. The way starts off easy enough as it parallels FR 4440 for 0.4 mile to its terminus at the appropriately named Roads End Campground. Now with road gone, enter the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness. Following alongside the Twisp River, the trail alternates between lush groves of forest and warm, brushy avalanche slopes. The grade is gentle. In late spring songbirds are abundant in the shrubs and thickets lining the valley floor. Look for the elegant western tanager among the avian choir.<br><br>Eventually the grade steepens. At 2 miles, at the confluence of the North and South Forks of the Twisp River, come to a junction (elev. 4400 ft). The trail left heads to Twisp Pass. Instead, bear right onto Trail No. 426, the path less chosen. Following the North Fork in cool groves of old conifers, the trail marches up the broad valley. Cross the North Fork at 3.5 miles (elev. 5200 ft) and prepare to work. The way now climbs steadily and steeply. Hastily built by prospectors intent on reaching their claims, the trail heads for the pass in a most direct fashion.<br><br>Forest yields to meadows matted in heather and wildflowers. At 5 miles crest the 6760-foot pass. Wipe your brow and take in the views. Early Winters Spires, Stiletto Peak, and Frisco Mountain, all familiar sights along the North Cascades Highway, reveal different facades from your new outpost. The big snowy peak to the west is Goode Mountain. In fact, it&apos;s all good up here.\n                 ",

Then mosey down an old carriage road that once provided passage for prospectors at Bridge Creek. The ore is long gone, but the environs flourish with lore. And the views from this old transportation route are moving.<br><br>You won&apos;t find Howard Lake on maps just yet. State officials only recently agreed to the new name for the small body of water formerly known as Coon Lake. Why the change? Well, despite what some locals claim was a reference to raccoons (which I can&apos;t recall ever seeing in these parts), the lake&apos;s name actually came from a racial epithet for a nineteenth-century black prospector (who did work these parts). Now, I&apos;m no big fan of political correctness (it often stifles honest discourse), and I despise revisionist history (it often deceives), but I&apos;m all for decency and respect. Howard Lake works for me, honoring instead of disparaging a hard-working individual. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names, however, has yet to recognize the new name.<br><br>From behind the historic Civilian Conservation Corps-era High Bridge Guard Station, pick up the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and head north. At 0.4 mile, after negotiating a short series of steep switchbacks, reach a junction (elev. 1850 ft). Continue left on the PCT.

Still gaining elevation, ignore a side trail right (it&apos;s used by equestrians to access a viewpoint), staying on the PCT through groves of big old ponderosa pine.<br><br>Emerge on a small ledge that grants viewing into the valley below. Then at 1.3 miles, arrive at Howard Lake (elev. 2180 ft). More wetland than lake, the area teems with birdlife. Mighty McGregor Mountain rises above. After enjoying the lake, head back 0.9 mile to the first junction.<br><br>Now continue east on what was once the wagon road for the mining settlement of High Bridge. Beneath cliffs, cross an open talus slope and enjoy views south into the Agnes Creek valley. Reenter forest and continue descending. Bear right at a junction, and in 0.3 mile (1.1 miles from the PCT junction) come to the trail&apos;s end at Bullion Camp on the Stehekin River Road.

In 0.25 mile beyond that, round a bend and take in a nice view of 8115-foot Agnes Mountain guarding the valley.

On your journey upward, walk the beach, cross under one of the most scenic bridges in the state, and check out the twisted trunks of the Pacific Madrone trees on the way. <br><br>Start your hike at the far west end of Cranberry Lake. Walk to the amphitheater and locate the trail on the far side. This is the North Beach trail. Follow the wide, well-built trail for almost a mile as it climbs above North Beach toward the bridge. Once you reach the bridge, the trail crosses under it, giving you a chance to admire the engineering. Started in August of 1934 and completed in July of 1935, the bridge and much of the park was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the height of the Great Depression. <br><br>Once you cross under the bridge, the trail forks, keep left, you want to follow the Perimeter Trail. The trail forks again. Keep left again, following the Perimeter Trail still. As you hike, you will see some small trails heading a short way down toward the water, they lead to some views of Mount Baker through the trees.<br><br>Following the Perimeter Trail takes you around the side of Goose Rock and above the shores of Cornet Bay. The trail drops down close to the beach before heading up again. There is a side trail to the left, but that is not your trail, take the one to the right that heads uphill. Hike along an open, grassy area on a rocky hillside, in spring look for the pink flowers of wild currant. Look out at Cornet Bay and on a sunny day, Mount Baker in the distance. All along this section notice the contorted branches and peeling red bark of the native madrone trees. These will have clusters of flowers in the spring, and red-orange berries in the fall. Some of these trees are quite old, with huge trunks and grey bark at the base. <br><br>The trail drops down to a well signed intersection. Here you meet the Summit Trail. Take this one; it&#x2019;s time to head to the top! The trail climbs steeply, then switchbacks through the woods. Climb out of the trees and hit the first of what is called &#x2018;the Balds&#x2019;. Bald refers to an area scraped to the bedrock by receding glaciers at the end of the last ice age. A good look at the rock and you can see the striations. It has taken thousands of years to build up enough topsoil on top of the rock to grow the plants in this meadow. Get down on your knees and look carefully, see how many different kinds of mosses, stonecrops and other plants you can find!  Please don&#x2019;t destroy them by careless walking. <br><br>Follow the path, and head up and under the power lines. Here will be some great views of the Cascade peaks along the Mountain Loop Highway. From here, you can follow a trail over to the high point and the top of Goose Rock at 484 feet. From the top you can see the Olympics, across the water to the San Juan Islands, and just below you, Cranberry Lake. Check out the view of the Naval Air Station and watch the jets on maneuvers.<br><br>When you are ready to head back, you have several routes to choose from. Take the Summit trail back to the start of the Perimeter trail and the bridge, or go back the way you came up, and hit the Discovery trail, cross Highway 20 by going under a pedestrian tunnel, and meet the North Beach trail on the other side of the bridge. From the North Beach trail, drop down to the beach and walk along the beach. There are picnic tables scattered about where beach meets woods. If the tide is out, you may be able to walk all the way back to the parking lot by way of the beach. If it is in, you will reach a dead end at the west point headland, backtrack and catch the trail again. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: This is a very popular park and the trails are well used. For maximum enjoyment, get here early! The park hours are: 6:30 AM-dusk April through September, 8:00 AM-dusk October-March.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>The McGregor Mountain trail is often described in guidebooks as &quot;brutal.&quot; Based on length and elevation alone, the description fits. McGregor is eight miles one way and gains more than 6,000 feet on its way to the summit. Few hikes put up bigger numbers; but you rack up the elevation at a comfortable rate of 800&apos; per mile, allowing many hikers to surprise themselves by what they can do on this trail. As long as you&apos;re used to spending ten hours in a day hiking, you may find yourself above 7,000 feet wondering what all the fuss was about. <br><br>Those who don&apos;t let themselves get scared off by the numbers find themselves in a world almost as far removed as you can get from the forested valley below. McGregor is the most prominent peak in the Stehekin Valley and towers over it at a maximum elevation of 8,000 feet. Even if you don&apos;t make it all the way to the top, you&apos;ll be in a true alpine environment. That - and the views - makes this one of the best hikes in the state. <br><br>As you climb, the trees thin, first turning to stunted sub-alpine firs then suddenly disappearing into open talus slopes and scattered larches. At the same time, breathtaking views open around you as you climb above Heaton Camp, less than a mile from the summit. Soon after, you reach trail&apos;s end, with nothing but boulders and scree waiting to be conquered. <br><br>Here the trail changes character. The final push to the summit is an exposed scramble. While presenting relatively little in the way of technical challenges, the footing is very loose in places, and rockfall is a real risk - particularly at the entry to the scramble. A fall here could easily be fatal, so even on level terrain, it&apos;s good to place good handholds. <br><br>The scramble route starts at the top of the talus and scree slope directly in front of the end of the trail. It is well marked with red and orange arrows painted on the rocks (you can also follow the old wire that presumably ran at one time to the lookout that has since deteriorated to almost nothing - the wire is surprisingly intact for being exposed to the elements for so long). At the top of the talus slope, you&apos;ll head to the right, then swing back to the left, then hit a gully with loose rock and boulders. Make sure no one is beneath you when you cross it, because it is easy to dislodge rock here, and once it starts going, it doesn&apos;t stop until it hits the talus slope below. Also make sure you have good handholds. From there, the trail angles further to the left and winds around until heading back to the right to a notch between McGregor to the right and a lower summit to the left. You&apos;ll cross a snowfield above the Sandalee Glacier before resuming an easier rock scramble to the true summit, marked by a radio repeater station. <br><br>The views are astounding.</p>\n                 ",

Stand high above the sparkling waters of America&apos;s third-deepest lake, which catches striking reflections of frosted pointy peaks. Feel rushes of wind funnel down the deep lake-cradling gorge. Listen to aspen leaves rustle, a lone loon cry, waves lap against lakeside ledges, and perhaps a rattling warning.<br><br>Mile per mile, this is the most scenic hike radiating from Stehekin, and it&apos;s the only trail that embraces the dramatic shoreline of 50-mile-long Lake Chelan. Hot in summer, the Lakeshore Trail makes a wonderful destination in fall and spring-especially the latter, when a mosaic of wildflowers including chocolate lilies, balsamroot, and death camas splash the shoreline ledges and grassy slopes in an array of brilliant colors.<br><br>Starting from the Golden West Visitor Center, the trail passes park buildings, an overflow camping area, and a handful of private cabins before settling into a more natural setting. After immediately sampling high-ledge scenery, drop down closer to lake level and enter a recent burn zone. The trail undulates between patches of greenery and ghost forests created by the Rex Creek Fire of 2001 and the Flick Creek Fire of 2006. Be particularly careful while hiking in windy and rainy conditions, as the potential exists for falling snags and landslides.<br><br>At 0.75 mile cross Hazard Creek and skirt some more cabins. The trail winds through and around pockets of private property. Many of the structures are simple and blend in well with the surroundings. Unfortunately, new money has found its way to these shores, with new ostentatious &quot;cabins&quot; sprouting up and clashing with this natural landscape and environmental sensibilities.<br><br>At just over 1 mile come to a shoreline ledge granting an excellent view down the lake to Moore Point and Domke Mountain. Continue along the scenic shoreline a short way before once again climbing above and away from it. After passing an old rock wall and compound, cross cottonwood-lined Fourmile Creek on a bridge at 2.5 miles. Drop back to lake level, passing boulders and a big &quot;cabin,&quot; and then following cascading Flick Creek into a little chasm.<br><br>Leave the creek behind and emerge on a high bluff that grants an excellent view back to Stehekin, with 7161-foot Purple Mountain rising above it. At 3.6 miles pass the Flick Creek campground and shelter, a nice spot for a break. More fine shoreline walking follows, and then start a long ascent.<br><br>Cross Hunts Creek in a deep ravine before more climbing, emerging onto a series of ledges before topping out at 1700 feet on Hunts Bluff. Here, 5 miles from Stehekin, is a good turnaround point. Enjoy the spectacular view up the lake to Stehekin and McGregor Mountain and down the lake to Moore Point. This is quite a different Lake Chelan than 40 miles to the south, where jet skis whine in circles and condos ravenously consume the hillsides.</p>\n                 ",

Those willing to complete the eight miles and 5,700 feet of climbing needed to reach the pass are rewarded with incredible views of the lake gorge, the Stehekin Valley and peaks stretching from the Cascade Pass area to the Glacier Peak Wilderness. <br><br>The trail starts just behind the Golden West Visitor Center on the south end of the Stehekin Landing. It follows the Purple Creek-Imus nature trail for a short distance before branching off to the right and beginning its steady climb uphill. At this point, buckle in - you have a long hike ahead of you. Plenty of water is a must-have, because the last source of water on the trail is the crossing of Purple Creek, which comes too early to be of much use. <br><br>Much of the early trail is still scarred by wildfire, and it&apos;s not uncommon for dead, charred trees to fall and block the trail. Trail work in 2011 cleared many of these, so the route is clear until you reach 4,000 feet in elevation. Above 5,500 feet, the trail was mostly spared from the wildfires, so it&apos;s only between these two points that blowdowns are a likely obstacle (although this could easily change at any time, particularly over the winter). <br><br>The trail climbs up the slope above Stehekin for a mile or two before crossing back into the Purple Creek drainage. The trail traverses to the south-facing back side of the ridge on the downlake side of the drainage. This section of the trail is hot, dusty, dry and brushy. Footing at times can be loose and presents a potential danger while hiking. <br><br>After what seems like an interminable series of switchbacks, you once again cross the ridge line and attain the Purple Creek drainage at 5,500 feet in elevation. The trail starts to yield its rewards at this point - wildflowers, old-growth subalpine firs, and views of glaciated peaks to the north and west. A final traverse of a granite face brings you to the pass at 6,884 feet. <br><br>From here, views open up in all directions. You&apos;ll get partial views of Glacier Peak and direct views of the peaks around Holden. You get a commanding and unique view of Lake Chelan and the impressive face of the ridge towering above the far shore. To the east is a basin full of pine and larch. <br><br>You can either start back down or follow the trail around an unmarked 7,200&apos; butte to a junction that will take you down to a small lake in the basin or - if you want even more climbing - up to 7,400&apos; Boulder Butte. <br><br>Either way, it will have been a rewarding day; and if you believe that the effort of a big hike is a reward in and of itself, then there are few trails more rewarding than this.</p>\n                 ",

Miraculously, Huckleberry Mountain&apos;s trail and more importantly its forests were spared this fate.

But more than mere time is required for this trek; you&apos;ll also need excellent endurance and a good cardiovascular system.<br><br>Starting under a glorious canopy of ancient Douglas-fir, the trail begins its long and winding way up the mountain. While the grade is good and the tread intact, undergrowth is encroaching upon this trail that receives little maintenance. (Actually, in these days of budgetary neglect, most of our trails receive little maintenance - a national shame.)<br><br>The trail alternates between short switchbacks and long traverses as it works its way up the broad mile-high peak.

Only two small areas, just 25 percent of the Finney Block, remain roadless. The Mount Higgins area consists of 13,000 acres and has some of the last miles of maintained trail in the Finney Block. The area surely would have been logged too if not for legal actions taken by conservationists in the 1990s. This tract should be wilderness and its obliterated and abandoned trails should be resurrected.<br><br>Continue through magnificent forest. Use caution on the old puncheon (cedar planks) frequently encountered along the way; much of it is rotting, slippery, and contorted.

    "desc": "\n                    <p>This is a hike along the Boulder River into its namesake wilderness. Young families will enjoy the gentle grade and views of the waterfalls crashing into the river from the steep banks opposite the trail, while those who continue along the up and downs to the trails&#x2019; end will be rewarded by a nice lunch spot beside the wild river. This is a relatively easy, popular hike off the Mountain Loop Highway, so WTA crews visit this location annually to repair any damage it has sustained during winter storms.<br><br>The trail starts on a nice wide flat trail, once an old railroad logging grade. As you approach the river, you can hear the crash of Boulder Falls, but can only glimpse it through the trees. The bank is steep and there is no access at this point. Pass a nice camp spot and the Boulder River Wilderness sign in about a mile from the trailhead. Soon there will be a break in the trees, and the river can finally be seen. <br><br>Continue on a short distance and behold a beautiful double unnamed waterfall! Admire the dripping moss and bright yellow monkey flower between the two braids of water. Keep going and soon come to a short switchback. As you make your first switch, there on the left hand side is a huge old-growth tree made for hugging. Notice more old-growth now along the trail, saved by the wilderness boundary. Another waterfall awaits your camera further up the trail, so once you&apos;ve hugged the tree, continue on. After the second big waterfall, at one and a half miles, the trail climbs away from the river.  Although there are no mountain views, the forest here is still beautiful. <br><br>Stately sword fern, soft maidenhair fern, deer fern, moss and twinflower line the path. Still mostly good trail, there are some rocky, rooty and muddy spots along this section. The trail will drop down and cross a few creeks before climbing one more time. The trail eventually levels out, then drops down, crosses a muddy swamp, and ends at a nice camp spot along the river, a good place for lunch and maybe a little wading. This used to be called Boulder Ford, as the trail once continued on to Tupso Pass and Three Fingers Lookout. Sadly, there is nothing left of it now.</p>\n                 ",

The longer trail meanders along the banks of the Sauk River, sections of which were once part of the old pioneer trail linking Darrington to the Monte Cristo mines. Scattered mossy cedar stumps are telltale signs that long ago the area was once partially logged. Joyfully, a lovely forest remains. This gentle trail makes it easy to slow down and enjoy the stately stands of Douglas-fir and cedar as well as to spy eagles, or perhaps an occasional coyote. <br><br>The loop is best done by heading north from the trailhead, where it follows an old roadbed through grand bigleaf maples before veering onto a terrace sprinkled with sky-scraping conifers. The trail skirts the edge of the terrace while wandering between giant volcanic boulders, reminders that Glacier Peak is just upriver. After a half mile the trail begins a short descent through a mixed alder forest to the river and a viewpoint. <br><br>Back on the terrace, the trail continues by dipping down and crossing a small seasonal creek, then passing above a man-made fish channel.

Beginning in forest interrupted by teaser views, work your way up a southern shoulder of the peak. After 1.5 miles or so, enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Subalpine forest punctuated by meadows and berry patches that warrant a return in September leads to a small ridge, after which you drop 100 feet to a pair of small ponds (elev. 5200 ft).<br><br>Not long afterward, lose the trees for good and enter a big, verdant (after all, this is &quot;Green&quot;Mountain) basin. Steeply traversing the basin at first, the trail then heads for a ridge crest above the emerald slopes. Be sure not to veer off the trail. The Forest Service is working hard trying to restore these loved-to-death meadows. Views expand exponentially as you march toward the summit. Be sure to take time to smell the myriad of flowers along the way. You may even spot a playful marmot or two.<br><br>At 4 well-deserved miles, Green&apos;s attractive 1933 fire lookout signals that you&apos;ve reached the top. Wipe the sweat from your brow and gaze out over a sea of green forest capped by waves of white summits. The Suiattle River valley, a deep U-shaped gorge, spreads out below you. Trace the wild waterway from its icy origins on Glacier Peak all the way to its confluence with the Sauk River.</p>\n                 ",

Among the most accessible of the alpine gems lacing jagged Sawtooth Ridge, reaching the Craters still exacts a fair amount of sweat and grit. But, while many of the nearby lakes often swirl in activity, Craters&apos; environs generally remain calm. Hikers are few, horses rare, motorcycles barred. Come here in October when golden larches light up the steep valley walls and you&apos;ll swear you found the pearly gates.<br><br>Why the Crater Lakes and a dozen other nearby alpine lakes were ever left out of the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness is beyond me. This is some of the finest backcountry east of the Cascade crest. Ecologically rich and graced with interconnecting trails, the Golden Lakes (a name given to this region by guidebook pioneers Harvey Manning and Ira Spring) should be a hiker&apos;s heaven. Instead, the Forest Service allowed motorized recreation in this region. Motorcyclists do indeed have a right to recreate on our public lands, but not on these lands may not be an apporiate location. The Golden Lakes are far too fragile and far too valuable for wildlife and passive recreation to be a backcountry speedway.<br><br>Fortunately, motorcycles are prohibited on the Crater Lakes Trail. But you&apos;ll have to first endure 0.7 mile of dust and throttle on Eagle Lakes Trail No. 431. Beginning in open forest, the wide throughway gently climbs. In 0.25 mile stop and admire views over the Crater Creek drainage. Those two gorgeous lakes I&apos;ve been extolling are up there in the shadows of Mount Bigelow, the prominent peak in front of you.<br><br>After a slight descent, cross Crater Creek (elev. 4825 ft) on a good bridge, enter a cool spruce grove and find the Crater Lake Trail taking off right. Immediately getting down to business, the trail climbs steeply up the narrow Crater Creek valley. At 1.25 miles from your start, cross the creek again and take a break before resuming your climb. Reach an outcropping and take another break, enjoying a good view east out to the Methow Valley sizzling in the sun. Start climbing again up more steep terrain.<br><br>At 4 miles rejoice as you enter a basin walled in by 8000-foot peaks. Lower Crater Lake (elev. 6814 ft) unfolds before you. Relax. As pretty as this lake is, Upper Crater is far more attractive. Recharge. Then work your way left (south) along the lakeshore to reach an inlet creek. Now on a somewhat defined path, follow the gurgling creek to reach the upper lake (elev. 6969 ft) in about 0.3 mile.\n                 ",

It travels through big ponderosa and sweet-scented sage to glistening granite ledges, granting extensive views of nearby rock and distant hazy hills.

At 4.5 miles (elev. 6700 ft) an obvious but unmaintained trail leaves left, dropping 200 feet to the forest-ringed Lower Eagle Lake.<br><br>Stay on the main trail for the upper lake. The climb eases. Now skirting a series of ledges, be sure to occasionally pause for the fine views of the lower lake twinkling below. At 5.5 miles (elev. 7050 ft) turn right onto a quiet side path. Motorcycles are barred on this short spur. Notice the soft delicate tread padded in larch needles, a far cry from the torn turf of the thoroughfare you left behind.<br><br>Pass a shallow tarn enveloped in showy larches. A half mile farther, arrive at Upper Eagle Lake (elev. 7110 ft). Cupped in a craggy, talus-laden cirque beneath 8135-foot Mount Bigelow, the lake sits in quite a dramatic setting.

You&apos;ll wander through a forest of moss-covered maple, cedar and fir, listening for wildlife and the sound of the river.<br><br>This is a nice easy, flat walk any time of year, but it is outstanding as a fall or winter outing. Come in the rain and enjoy this one as moss drips off the trees, mushrooms pop up through the forest floor and clouds float among the low hills.<br><br>Start with a small jaunt upstream, hiking along a beautifully graveled trail. A short way down the trail, reach a signed junction for Murphy Creek. This spur wanders through the woods, over a little bridge and between two large cedars, where there are some nice spots to view the river. Once you reach Murphy Creek, the trail ends and you rejoin the road. The creek isn&#x2019;t much, just another little feeder stream heading to add its waters to the mighty Sauk. But it&apos;s pretty, and a nice option for little legs. <br><br>Once back at the main graveled trail, follow it until it hits a regular dirt trail close to the river. The graveled trail is part of a new, one mile ADA loop, and worth taking for a short walk. To follow the trail along the river to the northern end, take the dirt path, along which you can hear the river, though it remains out of sight. <br><br>Enjoy the moss draped trees and green carpeted forest floor. In spring, look for twinflower and trillium. In fall, the yellow of turning devils club foliage, bigleaf maple and golden brown ferns add a splash of color to the bright green moss. How many kinds and colors of mushrooms can you find along the path? Mushrooms love the decaying wood of old stumps and leaves found here. <br><br>Since the river supports migrating steelhead, birders should keep an &#x2018;eagle eye&#x2019; out for osprey and herons, and in the winter, eagles. Cross a wooden bridge, and catch a view of the river. There are lots of places to see its waters, and some access to its banks if you climb steeply down. This area was logged in the 1930s, and along this section one can see the remnants of old growth stumps, the springboard cuts barely visible. Notice some 100 foot tall trees that have grown from these old stumps. One grand old stump supports a vine maple, a hemlock, ferns and a huckleberry! <br><br>Reach the end of the trail at the north parking lot and turn around. On your way back, you will come to the intersection with the ADA graveled trail. You have two choices. You can go left along the lower part of the loop, and come out where you started, or go to the right and wind through the trees upward to the main parking lot on a different route. Either way, it&#x2019;s pretty and green. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip:  Do you have out of town guests? Make this part of a Mountain Loop day. Pick up picnic supplies in Darrington, then come and walk the short graveled loop trail. Enjoy your lunch at the nice picnic tables here. Continue around the loop, showing off the great Northwest scenery. Stop frequently, take many pictures, then visit the Ice Caves and have dinner in Granite Falls.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Mount Pugh -- also known by its native name &quot;Da Klagwats&quot; -- has one of the most spectacular viewpoints in the North Cascades, offering a vista that includes Glacier and Sloan Peak, Mounts Baker, Shuksan, and Rainier, the Olympics, Monte Cristo, Three Fingers, and White Chuck. The first fire lookout here was established in 1916; a lowly tent perched on the peak until a cabin with a cupola was built in 1922. This was hit by lightning in 1927 and a second lookout was built, but it was subsequently destroyed in 1965 and never rebuilt. Remains of these structures can still be seen on the mountain, when you can tear yourself away from the view. <br><br>But you&apos;ll have to earn the views on this hike. Even for conditioned hikers this is a physically demanding hike with almost 5,300 feet of elevation gain in a little over five miles. A scramble section with some exposed areas can be treacherous in snow or adverse weather conditions and intimidating to an unseasoned hiker. If you can safely navigate this trail though, the rewards are many.<br><br>From the trailhead enjoy a pleasant hike through deep forest with several stream crossings. You&apos;ll gain a modest 1,300 feet to reach three and a half acre Lake Metan at 1.5 miles. Immediately you will see a &quot;T&quot; in the trail when reaching the lake. The trail to the right leads to several primitive camping opportunities while the trail to the left is the main trail. If you look up from the &quot;T&quot; you will see your destination high above your head. Lake Metan is the final water source on the trail, so be sure to refill here; you&apos;ll need it.<br><br>From Lake Metan the grade steepens. Continue from the lake under the forest canopy as the trail switchbacks up the mountainside at a calf burning grade, eventually emerging at a boulder field in the basin below Stujack Pass, elevation 4,900 feet. This is a good spot for a break. Enjoy the view of Stujack Pass and listen for pikas squeaking in the boulder field.<br><br>From the boulder field, continue to Stujack Pass, hiking on talus slopes and through wildflower meadows stocked with Indian paintbrush, aster, yellow monkey flower, lupine, and many more. During your hike in the basin the views open up to Sloan Peak and Three Fingers, and the Sauk River Valley below. Views improve all the way to the summit and sometimes mountain goats can be seen. Beware that the trail is starting to slough off at places here, so avoid taking shortcuts, which can worsen the erosion problem.<br><br>From the saddle of Stujack Pass, elevation 5,750 feet, enjoy outstanding views. Many hikers will choose to end their hike here -- it&apos;s a good stopping point for hikers with pets or people with concerns about heights.<br><br>If you choose to proceed, leave Stujack Pass and enter Glacier Peak Wilderness, indicated by a weathered sign. From here, the trail turns into a scramble route. Continue around the northeast side of the mountain on a path blasted out of cliffs and on heather slopes. Eventually you will reach the remains of a tram that was used to supply the fire lookout. From this point the trail is exposed and you will continue along a razorback ridge with a permanent snowfield. The White Chuck River Valley spread out below you on your left and the Sauk River Valley on your right. Continue along the knife edge and arrive at a cleft above the glacial trough. Use your hands to continue scrambling, passing an iron ring protruding out of the rock. Sometimes there will be cairns in this section showing the way. This part of the hike is considered a non-technical scramble, but in times of snow or adverse weather conditions it is best left to those with mountaineering experience. If you can negotiate this, the rest of the way is steep but easy to follow.<br><br>When you finally reach the summit, relax and savor your well-earned achievement. Before you are glorious views in all directions, the most dramatic being Glacier Peak to the east of you. Rest among shards of granite and the remains of the former lookout enjoying one of the best viewpoints in the Cascades.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    With its many open views back toward Pugh Mountain, this trail offers an exceptional weekend outing in the winter wilderness. The trail begins gently enough, climbing along a wide, moderately pitched road. It then turns up a secondary valley and crawls along a narrower, steeper road. Finally, the route becomes a narrow, winding single-track trail in a dark, old forest. This section is not for the fainthearted nor for untested navigators. The trail is often hard to find, and snowshoers have to trust their skills with map, compass, and common-sense navigation to wend their way up the valley to the pretty little alpine lake lying between Circle Peak and Meadow Mountain.<br><br>Those who expend the considerable effort to hike the trail are amply rewarded. Along the way, the views and local scenery are magnificent: from sweeping panoramas that take in Pugh and White Chuck Mountains to up-close and personal encounters with the deep gray-green forest of old fir, hemlock, and cedar wrapped in a cloak of snow and frost. Snowshoers will leave most of the ski traffic behind as they peel away from the main track to Rat Trap Pass (see Route 17) and angle up the side valley of Crystal Creek and its headwaters at Crystal Lake. With fewer folks crowding the route, wildlife is more visible--the ever-present whiskey jack whistles all along the route, while weasels, ptarmigans, and even a few sly foxes have been spotted as well.<br><br>From the road junction, hike up the road as if heading toward Rat Trap Pass. The first 2.5 miles offer some nice views of Glacier Peak, Pugh Mountain, and the White Chuck River valley from a gentle trail. At the junction of FR27 and the smaller FR 2710, go right onto FR 2710 to begin the climb up into the Crystal Creek valley. The road switches back a time or two, climbing some 500 feet in less than 0.5 mile before rolling into a long traverse up the valley. The road stays well above the creek itself, but the steep side-walls above the road provide their own problems. Snow conditions must be scrupulously checked before entering this valley because a high degree of avalanche danger can exist.<br><br>The road forks in 1.5 miles from the FR 27 junction. Stay left to remain on the north side of Crystal Creek--the right fork slants down across the valley and then rolls out into a long, looping traverse above the White Chuck River. The route to Crystal Lake becomes narrower at the fork, but it holds fairly level as it continues to traverse upvalley to the road end, nearly 1.5 miles past the last fork.<br><br>The summer trailhead of the Crystal Lake Trail is found at the road end. The trail is a faint, seldom-maintained path that is difficult enough to find in August. Come winter, the path is visible only as an often-indistinct corridor through the trees. If the trail is lost below the snow, just pick the path of least resistance through the trees, staying on the north side of the creek while climbing gradually to the 4400-foot level.<br><br>In about a mile, at 4400-feet, the creek turns right as it drops over a modest falls. At this point the trail is down close to the creek banks, but it remains on the north side of the water until right before the lake is reached--about 0.25 mile above the falls. Crystal Lake is at 4485 feet, and from its shores, Circle Peak, Meadow Mountain, and the crown of White Chuck Mountain are visible. The lake basin offers plenty of fine sites for camping. Crystal Lake is seldom frozen solid enough for safe travel across it, so stick to the shorelines to prevent an unwanted plunge into the icy waters.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Backcountry<br>These routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses. These routes require complete competence in winter survival skills, avalanche and snow condition evaluation and some basic mountaineering skills.\n                 ",

Kick back and harvest berries at the lake or, if you&apos;re feeling energetic, head off for Circle Peak on a rehabilitated trail to an old lookout site with mouthwatering views.<br><br>Much of this hike uses old logging roads. While this assures an easy grade, look forward to a hot slog when the sun is beating down-there&apos;s no shade. When trees do begin to reclaim the roadbed and fringes, alders are the colonizers. If not cut back on a regular basis, the way can quickly take on a jungle ambience. Be forewarned. Bring loppers or an easy disposition.<br><br>Begin by following an old roadbed, climbing a few hundred feet and then losing most of it. Limited views of surrounding peaks break the scrappy alder monotony. At 1.5 miles (elev. 2800 ft), reach a junction. Crystal Creek Trail No. 638 departs left-take it. Now on a secondary old logging roadbed, follow Crystal Creek. With trail access closed for years, expect a route clogged with vegetation.<br><br>The grade is fairly easy for a mile or so, but then it&apos;s time to get serious. Leaving the creek behind, the trail works its way up a steep slope choked in thick regenerating growth. Traverse an old cut, and then head steeply straight up an old fire line. Yep, this area is a mess, the legacy of an era of intensive timber harvesting (ancient-forest slaughter). At the edge of the cut, come to a trail junction (elev. 4300 ft) that may or may not be signed. The trail left leads 4 miles on rehabilitated tread to Circle Peak.<br><br>For Crystal Lake continue to the right on real trail now, climbing more sanely and entering the Glacier Peak Wilderness, refuge from old clear-cuts and roads. In another 0.25 mile, Crystal Lake and its meadowy shores greet you. Enjoy-you deserve it.</p>\n                 ",

There were two search and rescue missions here in 2008.<br><br>The first 2.5 miles to Saddle Lake are usually soggy and sometimes feel like hiking up a stream. The lake is pretty and hemmed in tightly with trees.<br><br>The next two miles to Goat Flats start breaking out of the trees and are quite pretty. Goat Flats is a gorgeous meadow on top of a ridge. To the North are views down into a valley. There are a number of very nice campsites. Make sure you have something to keep the bears out of your food as bears are known to frequent the area.<br><br>The trail to Tin Can Gap follows the South side of the ridge and is mostly above the tree line.<br><br>At Tin Can Gap, the technical stuff starts. Ice axes are a must and crampons and a rope should be considered. Almost immediately, a small but quite steep snowfield must be crossed or skirted on the North side of the ridge. Late in the season you might be able to follow a small moat around to the high side for safety. If you cross the snowfield directly (the only way I have done it) I recommend chopping steps or wearing crampons. The rock on the far side can be rather thin (smooth) so be prepared to look for small hand and footholds. The trail will then cross the ridge and continue on the South face of the ridge.<br><br>After a bit, the trail will cross back to the North side of the ridge and you will run into the top of the Queest-Alb glacier. This is where one of the search and rescue missions occured. Most people continue onto the glacier and descend to where the trail crosses back to the South side of the ridge. This can be extremely slippery and dangerous. If you slip a best-case scenario is to slide about 200 feet into rocks. A worst case scenario is to miss the rocks and continue down several thousand feet to the crevasses at the bottom of the glacier. <br><br>Late season you can keep off of the glacier by staying in the moat between the top of the glacier and the rock. Finding the entrance to the moat can be a bit tricky in bad weather. Just before you reach the glacier there will be a sloping rock face to your right that continues along the ridge. Scramble up this easy face and you should reach a point where you can look down into the moat. At the time of this writing there was a handline tied to a small tree that you could use to get down into the moat. <br><br>Past the top of the glacier, the trail traverses back to the South side of the ridge and continues until you get to a snowfield below the summit. After crossing the snowfield you scramble on the rocks until you find the ladders up to the lookout. The three ladders are pure vertical.<br><br>If you have made it this far you will reach a very nice old fire lookout. It has incredible views and room for a few people to sleep. There is even some old fire spotting equipment.<br><br>The scramble book recommends 11 hours round trip. If you hike fast then you can make it up in about five hours and down in four.\n                 ",

En route take in ancient forest, a pastoral mountain lake, and acres of amazing meadows and parklands punctuated with tarns. And did I mention the bountiful berry patches?<br><br>The first half of this hike entails a rough and tumble trek over roots, rocks, ledges, and other generally uneven and unpleasant ankle-twisting terrain. Immediately after entering the Boulder River Wilderness, the way commences to cut a route through an old-growth jungle of monster cedars and a near-impenetrable understory of lush greenery. Following along a rugged ridge high above Boulder River, the going is slow, with occasional peekaboo views of the valley&apos;s sprawling old-growth drapery-as well as sporadic but exhilarating shots of impressive Three Fingers looming above.<br><br>After a slight descent, the trail heads upward once again, clambering around and over ledges to reach a signed trail junction at shallow and serene Saddle Lake at 2.5 miles (elev. 3770 ft). The trail right leads to Meadow Mountain. Grown over, it&apos;s rapidly fading into history; yet another casualty of the U.S. Forest Service&apos;s lack of trail funding (ask your senator or rep why). The trail to Tin Can Gap, however, improves from this point with smoother tread and gentler climbing. Grassy marshy meadows soon replace dark forest.<br><br>And tarns! Scores of them. Blueberries, huckleberries, bring out the barrel! Sweeping views of surrounding peaks and ridges-<br><br>Pilchuck, Whitehorse, Baker, and plenty of others-grow with each step forward. At 4.5 miles, after some moderate climbing, enter Goat Flat (elev. 4800 ft), a heather and berry plateau wonderland splotched with tarns and clusters of contorted mountain hemlock and subalpine fir. For many hikers this is far enough, contentment has already set in. Please respect this delicate and fragile environment.<br><br>Adventurous souls continue. Climb a small forested knoll before breaking out to traverse steep slopes saturated with wildflowers. Good trail continues to just below the gap. Then ascend a short, steep, rocky way to the 5800-foot tight rocky notch. Guard your breath-the view is sure to take it away. Staring you right in the face is Three Finger&apos;s trio of awe-inspiring appendages. The Queest-Alb Glacier spreads its icy blanket beneath them.<br><br>Traveling beyond this point is strictly for experienced scramblers and resident mountain goats.

Then head directly to the strait to explore a series of tide pools up close. Hike a steep trail down to a remote cliff-enclosed cove, or leisurely wander across a sandy beach on a picturesque bay.<br><br>Port Angeles residents have long known that some of the finest coastal scenery around can be found at nearby Salt Creek County Park. A one-time army post known as Camp Hayden, Clallam County Parks now manages the property complete with campground and trails. A 1500-acre Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) tract encompassing 1166-foot Striped Peak abuts the park to the east. Although heavily logged, the steep northern slopes of the mountain were spared, allowing you to hike amid huge Douglas-firs hundreds of years old.<br><br>The well-built but poorly marked trail takes off though a stand of big firs just to the northeast of the parking area. Hugging the hillside and not far from the coastline, wind through forested flats while listening to waves splash up against ledge and bluff. Continue deeper into the forest, climbing a bench high above the crashing surf. Enter a primeval grove of towering hemlocks, firs, and cedars. If access weren&apos;t so prohibitively difficult, these ancient giants surely would have been logged.<br><br>After twisting beneath one big tree after another, the trail climbs to a small dizzying viewpoint of an isolated cove 200 feet below. Be careful while admiring this vista! If you continue, keep skittish dogs and children nearby as the trail rounds the cove high above, coming to a side trail at 1 mile. The trail left drops rapidly to the remote cove. It&apos;s worth the effort, but other beaches in the park can be more easily accessed.<br><br>The main trail continues up a damp ravine-a dense fern alley-and uniform second growth replaces the big trees. Cross numerous side creeks that flow down the dark slope. Turning south, the trail climbs steeply, skirting an old cut to emerge on a dirt road at 2.4 miles (elev. <br><br>900 ft). Follow the road right a short distance to a viewpoint over a vast expanse of saltwater and Canadian soil. Mount Baker, the San Juans, and Port Angeles can all be seen to the east. Unfortunately, past visitors arriving by motor have not left the summit too appealing, leaving scads of trash behind. (Put the litterers on a chain gang to pick up after themselves!)<br><br>It&apos;s possible to return to the trailhead via a series of DNR roads, but it&apos;s a confusing route and often not very scenic, so best to return the way you came.\n                 ",

Old-growth trees  reach for the sky on either side of a brush-free trail, since understory is minimal when big old trees block out the sunlight. Find fantastic mushrooms here in the fall and forest wildflowers in the spring and early summer. <br><br>Since the Whitechuck Trail has been washed out this trail has become the main route to climb Glacier Peak. Climbers mix with backpackers and day hikers on the way to various destinations.<br><br>The North Fork Sauk River is never far away, and always in earshot, but seldom seen. At two miles is a junction with the trail to Pilot Ridge. A short walk on a spur trail here takes you over to the North Fork Sauk River. This is among the best viewpoints of the river. <br><br>The route has numerous small ups and downs, meandering alongside the river. At the 4-mile mark is Red Creek, where a new bridge makes crossing a snap. During the time that there was no bridge this was a difficult ford, but now hikers can easily carry on to Mackinaw Shelter at 5.5 miles, where the North Fork Sauk River hike ends and climbing begins. <br><br>Go as far as you like. This can be a short hike to the junction with the Pilot Ridge Trail, or up to 11 miles roundtrip to the shelter and back. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: If you can&apos;t have a hike without views, you can find them, even on this trail. Soon after leaving the trailhead, come to a junction with the Red Mountain Trail. Turning onto this trail, hike one mile. You&apos;ll gain 700 feet of elevation before you arrive at the site of the old Red Mountain Lookout. <br><br>This is not the top of the mountain but a good viewpoint nonetheless.

Look in tidal pools for semisubmerged starfish tenaciously clinging to barnacle-encrusted walls. Look for oystercatchers cruising down the aisles of this open fish market. Look up in the towering trees hugging the shoreline for perched eagles.<br><br>Search for Makah petroglyphs etched into the Wedding Rocks, a cluster of shore-hugging boulders about halfway along the coast. Respect these historic and sacred artifacts, which predate European settlement in the Northwest. If the tide is low, continue along the surf. If it is high, use the steep but short trails (signed) that bound over rough headlands. Continue on wide beach and approach another spot that may require a detour if the surf is high.<br><br>At 3 miles from Cape Alava and after 6.3 miles of hiking, you&apos;ll arrive at Sand Point. Over 2 glorious miles of some of the finest sandy beaches in all of Washington extend south from this point.<br><br>When you must relinquish this heavenly environment back to its rightful owners-the seals, oystercatchers, otters, and sanderlings-return to Lake Ozette via another 3-mile-long boardwalk trail through expansive cedar bogs and under a dense canopy of majestic Sitka spruce.

One of Washington&apos;s best saltwater strolls is along its &quot;north coast, &quot;the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Actually, this hike heads directly into the strait on the longest coastal spit in the continental United States. A narrow strip of sand, dune, and beached logs, the Dungeness Spit protrudes over 5 miles straight into the strait. Prone to breaching during storms, the spit is also resilient and well-established-and well-hiked and loved by those who explore it.<br><br>The Dungeness Spit was formed by wind and water currents that forced river silt and glacial till to arch into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Over the centuries the spit has grown to over 5 miles. You can hike all the way to the tip, where a lighthouse has been keeping guard since 1857. The extreme tip, however, like the Dungeness Bay side of the spit, is closed to public entry to protect important wildlife habitat. Because the spit is protected and managed as a wildlife refuge, many recreational activities are restricted. Please respect areas closed to public visitation.<br><br>Try to do this hike during low tide for easier walking. Lying within the Olympic rain shadow, the spit receives less than 20 inches of rainfall annually, making it a great winter destination when surrounding areas are socked in. Pack your binoculars too, as the bird-watching is supreme. Over 250 species have been recorded on the spit and in Dungeness Bay, including many that are endangered or threatened. Marbled murrelets, harlequin ducks, and snowy plovers frequent the area.<br><br>Follow the refuge trail 0.5 mile through cool maritime forest. Before descending to the beach, take in sweeping views of the spit from an overlook. Now drop 100 feet, emerging at the base of tall bluffs and at the start of the spit. It&apos;s a straightforward hike to the lighthouse. Pack plenty of water and sunscreen. If the 11-mile round trip seems daunting, any distance hiked along the spit will be rewarding.<br><br>If you head south from the trail, you can wander for over a mile on oft-deserted beaches under golden bluffs. Mount Angeles hovering in the distance may very well lure you this way. No matter which way you venture, expect some of the best beach hiking around.\n                 ",

Where it intersects the ridge, be sure to stop and enjoy the views to the north. Particularly striking is the view up the ridge to the cliffs of Dickerman&#x2019;s summit, hanging high above the Perry Creek drainage. After a third of a mile, the trail heads east, away from the ridge and out into the open, south-facing slopes below the summit. <br><br>Here, fields of blueberries bask in the sun, making it one of the first places in the Cascades where this scarce crop fully ripens. <br><br>The trail resorts once again to switchbacks on its steady climb through the meadows, with a brief pause for a side trail to a vantage point with direct views of the summits of Gothic Basin and Monte Cristo. In another third of a mile, you reach the summit ridge. <br><br>Several groves of trees force a bit of a choice here: stay below the summit and gaze south or stand on the very top and gaze north. There is no bad decision, since views to either direction are spectacular. <br><br>The summit drops away sharply to the north into the adjacent valleys between Stillaguamish Peak, Mount Forgotten and Twin Peaks. The occasional mountain goat may play peekaboo from the rocky ledges below the summit, but be careful when playing along; the north side of the summit is nothing but a sheer dropoff. <br><br>Looking back to the west and north, you can scan through all the major peaks of the northern Mountain Loop: Three Fingers, Whitehorse, White Chuck, Pugh and Sloan, while Baker, Shuksan and Glacier Peak hover above and seemingly just beyond. On your way down, the visual trek continues through Monte Cristo, Del Campo, Morningstar, Sperry, Vesper, Big Four, and Pilchuck. <br><br>With the possible exception of Hidden Lake Lookout, this is the finest summit view around--a rare chance to get so close to so many other summits at the same time. Mount Dickerman may have asked a lot of you to get here, but it will have more than held up its end of the bargain.</p>\n                 ",

This route offers all the beauty and majesty found in the wintry mountains without the stren&#xAC;uous workout usually required to see such splendor. It is perfect for taking the family on a gentle snowshoe stroll or for introducing newbies to the joys of snowshoeing. <br><br>The trail is wide - actually, most of the &quot;trail&quot; is on a section of the unplowed Mountain Loop Highway - and flat, so first-timers can get the feel for walking on snowshoes without having to worry about climbing, crossing, or descending steep slopes. But despite its mild nature, this trail accesses some truly wild country. Trekking up to the base of Big Four Mountain, snowshoers can gawk in awe at the towering peak before them. The granite monolith of Big Four, with its long icicle fingers and snowy cap, captivates most visitors, but it&apos;s not the only natural wonder found here. Huge ancient trees, a clear, ice-rimmed river, and hordes of animals--big and small--are here to enjoy as well.<br><br>Leave the parking area and trek up the snowbound Mountain Loop Highway as it follows the Stillaguamish River upstream. The road is lined with towering cedar and fir trees--many of which sport long, flowing beards of green. At 0.5 mile, cross the sparkling waters of Coal Creek as it rushes in from the north to empty into the Stillaguamish. Follow the road more than 2 miles until a small side road veers away to the right. This is the entrance to the Big Four Picnic Area and the trailhead for the Big Four Ice Caves Trail. <br><br>The ice caves themselves are typically blocked by early December--heavy snowfall and continual avalanches keep the caves capped tight throughout the winter--but the 1-mile trail from the picnic area is worth exploring. The trail leads to the base of Big Four and, along the way, offers outstanding views of the giant rock face of the mountain. Though it may be tempting to snowshoe right up to the jumbled pile of snow at the mouth of the ice caves, resist that temptation. That pile of snowballs is what remains of the devastating avalanches that flash down the side of the mountain after every snowstorm and after most sunny mornings. The bright sun on the rock face weakens the snow and ice, sending it crashing down on the trail below with absolutely no warning.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Easiest. <br>Generally good trails for beginners, with little elevation change and minimal avalanche danger.</p>\n                 ",

Hikers of all ages and abilities can enjoy this trail.<br><br>Start at the trailhead parking lot and follow the paved pathway through the woods. Marvel at a large stump laying on its side, roots facing the trail. Soon you will come to an intersection. On your right, a boardwalk crosses a marsh and leads you to a flat grassy field and a picnic area. This is the site of an old hotel, but not much remains now except a large chimney. <br><br>To reach the viewpoint into the caves, continue straight, crossing the Stillaguamish River on an aluminum bridge high above. Look down and notice the old trail below. WTA helped create the new, higher trail you&apos;re walking on and the bridge was installed in order to withstand the flooding and washouts that have plagued this trail in the past. In a few steps you will cross Ice Creek, just before it flows into the Stillaguamish. The path continues on a gentle upward grade, on some gravel and mostly boardwalk through the forest. <br><br>Marvel at the power of nature in the swath of wind-snapped trees beside the trail. Continuing on, the trail breaks out into an open meadow beside a creek. You will now have a good view of Big Four Mountain and the waterfalls sheeting down the cliff face. Turn from the mountain for a minute and check out the wildflowers beside the trail. In late spring you will see trillium, then valerian, queens cup and some nice stands of bright magenta fireweed. <br><br>You now have your first view of the caves. Formed by melting snow, waterfalls from the above cliff and wind, they are really snow caves under an avalanche chute. Inviting as they look on a warm day, there are signs everywhere warning of the danger. Do not go into or climb on top of the caves! Other hikers may  be doing just this, so parents, have your &#x201C;Just because everybody else does it&#x2026;&#x201D; speech ready. The signs are there for a reason; people have been killed here as recently as 2011 by avalanches in the spring and collapsing snow bridges in the summer. There is a plaque at the end of the trail in memory of Grace Tam, an 11-year old girl who was killed in 2011. It serves as a reminder of the ever-changing nature of this area, and the potential for danger that the melting ice holds. <br><br>The trail ends in a circle of rocks prefect for safely admiring the caves, Big Four and the surrounding beauty. On your way back to the car, take the boardwalk across the marsh, watching for birds, dragonflies and frogs. Have a picnic, check out the old hotel site and call it a good day. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: If you&apos;re planning on camping in the area, pack a thermos of hot cocoa, come back at night with a blanket to throw on the grass in the meadow and watch the night sky.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Perry Creek proves you can have it all, and you can have it all in one hike &#x2013; old growth forest, wildflowers, waterfalls, meadows, expansive mountain views, even lakes! As if that weren&#x2019;t enough, it also provides access to two summit scrambles and, in the right season, a wealth of wild blueberries and fall color. <br><br>Tread lightly, and stay on the trail! In recognition of the incredible diversity of native plant life here &#x2013; a stunning concentration of species rarely seen anywhere else in the Cascades &#x2013; the entire area from the tip of Stillaguamish Peak to the summit of Mount Forgotten to the top of Mount Dickerman is a research natural area that could (in theory) be closed to all but scientific use. Thankfully, it&apos;s not, and hikers can enjoy the flora of this area. <br><br>Start at the trailhead for Mount Dickerman. The Perry Creek trail leaves from the west end of the parking lot. The first mile is a mostly flat section that connects to an old road that leads a fifth of a mile to the former trailhead. At the occasional open spot along the way, enjoy views of Big Four Mountain&#x2019;s north face and snowfields. <br><br>After a short stretch in dense forest, the trail breaks out into the open. From here, the same attributes that make the Perry Creek drainage so hospitable to so many different types of plants make it an awesome place to hike. The trail traverses the east side of the drainage, which is frequently intersected by talus slopes from the steep rock of Mount Dickerman overhead. These disturbed areas allow sunlight to reach hillsides that would otherwise be shaded by conifers, giving perennial plants a chance to flourish and providing hikers with views over the lush canopy below. On the far side of the creek, gaze upon waterfalls pouring down from green meadows on the upper slopes of Stillaguamish Peak. Where shade persists on the trail, abundant rain from the Puget Sound Convergence Zone carpets every available surface with thick moss. In places, ancient old-growth cedars rub shoulders with deciduous hardwoods. <br><br>To the untrained eye, all this may seem merely scenic; but there are some 250 different species of plant life here, many of them in the short distance below Perry Creek Falls. After years of lobbying by the Washington Native Plant Society and noted botanist Art Kruckeberg, the biodiversity found here led the Forest Service to set the area aside in 1997 as a research natural area. As wild as the environs of the entire Mountain Loop might feel, Perry Creek falls just outside of both the nearby Henry M. Jackson and Glacier Peak Wildernesses. The research natural area designation gives it something of a status even more protected than that of a wilderness &#x2013; the Forest Service&#x2019;s guidelines call for not encouraging recreational activities in a national research area, since the area is meant to be &#x201C;unmodified.&#x201D; Camping and fires, though not expressly prohibited in the Perry Creek area, are discouraged. <br><br>Two miles from the old trailhead, the trail reaches Perry Creek Falls, a tall rocky tumble of rushing whitewater. Unfortunately, much of the falls is hidden under a steep overhang; if you approach the edge for a look down, do so with great caution. For many, this makes a good destination in and of itself, but the trail continues on, crossing over Perry Creek a short distance above the falls. Past this overlook, there is no bridge, so be prepared to get your feet wet when the water is high, and turn around if you&apos;re uncomfortable. Head into old-growth forest on the west side of the gorge. Here the way steepens as it switchbacks through the trees, gaining 2,000 feet in two miles. <br><br>A little over a mile and a half from the creek crossing, the trail seems to branch off to the left. A short walk takes you to a saddle looking out at the deep valley between Stillaguamish Peak and Mount Forgotten. Some guidebooks identify this as the Mount Forgotten Meadows, but it is in fact the beginning of a rough climber&#x2019;s trail that heads off to Stillaguamish Peak. Return to the trail (or stay right all along) and in a third of a mile or so, reach the actual meadows, marked by a high point to the left and tarns to the right. <br><br>It may have been a long haul to get here, but the views are worth it. Across the tarns, look out to the meadow&#x2019;s namesake, Mount Forgotten, to which a much rougher climbers&#x2019; trail continues. In fall, blueberries abound, attracting not only keen-eyed hikers but the occasional bear as well. <br><br>As you continue back, the greatest reward of all may still await: another chance to appreciate a place where sun, rain, and terrain converge to produce an incomparably rich explosion of life.</p>\n                 ",

That&apos;s a mistake that snowshoers can quietly take advantage of. The Coal Creek valley is the first large valley leading north away from the Mountain Loop Highway, and it offers outstanding opportunities to trek through untouched meadows, open stands of forest, and along clear, sparkling creeks.

The trail is frequented by cross-country skiers, but if snowshoers just think of skiers as fellow snowshoers who prefer long, skinny snowshoes, there is no problem sharing the trail. After all, there is plenty of wonderful country and splendid scenery here for everyone to enjoy. The route follows a small road that parallels Deer Creek on its way up the valley to the Kelcema Lake trailhead. The route climbs steadily, but at a gentle enough rate that snowshoers of all abilities will enjoy this outing. In addition to a gentle climb, the route offers beautiful old forests to explore, open clearcut meadows to play in, and high craggy ridges and peaks to admire.<br><br>Find the start of Deer Creek Road (FR 4052) near the eastern edge of the parking area and start snowshoeing up the road. The lower section is frequently crowded with families sliding on inner tubes and sleds. Be careful not to trudge across their line of descent as they are more often than not plummeting downhill, out of control. Also, as a matter of courtesy, while trekking up the road try to avoid stomping down the twin grooves carved by cross-country skis. <br><br>As the road climbs through the first, thick grove of second-growth forest, the views are limited to the roadway itself. After just a mile, the road slowly banks west, following the course of the creek, and you can catch a few glimpses north of the crown of Bald Mountain. Gradually, the views increase in quantity and quality. The narrow road continues to roll upstream, as the thick second-growth forest gives way first to small clearcuts and then to older, more mature forests. Near the 2.5-mile mark, stop for a breather and you will find the increasingly pretty views before you are nothing compared to the scenery at your back. Turn around and look down the valley to see a skyline punctuated by Big Four Mountain, and Sperry, Vesper, and Little Chief Peaks.<br><br>At 3.5 miles, the trail crosses Deer Creek--stay to the center of the bridge to avoid sloughing snow--and climbs out of the valley bottom. The road gains elevation steeply for the next mile as it sweeps west before switching back to climb toward the headwaters of the creek. At 4.5 miles, the road recrosses the creek and runs into the Kelcema Lake trailhead.<br><br>The road continues west for another 0.25 mile, and most cross-country skiers will follow it out. With wide snowshoes you have a decided advantage over skinny skis on forest trails, so turn left just after crossing the creek and climb the Kelcema Lake Trail. This narrow path weaves through old second-growth forest--with a few ancient giants left to inspire the younger trees--for 0.5 mile. The trail climbs gently along this stretch, and because the trail corridor is fairly wide, the route is easy to follow. The lake is met near the outlet stream, and some nice campsites are scattered along its shores as well as plenty of places to sit and enjoy a quiet lunch while soaking in the beauty of the region. Bald Mountain, to the south, towers over the lake basin, and Devils Peak is visible across the valley to the east.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful.

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Historically significant and naturally beautiful, the trail through Robe Canyon is a worthy hiking destination any time of year.<br><br>120 years ago, railroad crews faced the daunting challenge of building tracks along a flood-prone river to connect the mines at Monte Cristo with the smelters in Everett. A narrow canyon east of Granite Falls proved to be a particularly challenging spot to lay tracks; frequent floods and rock slides destroyed not only the tracks, but also the settlement of Robe. The repair costs were high, and the line was eventually abandoned. Fortunately, today&#x2019;s hikers can still enjoy the area thanks to a Boy Scout troop, who built the trail in the 1960s, and the Snohomish County Parks Department, who created the Robe Canyon Historic Park in the 1990s.<br><br>The well-maintained trail quickly leaves the Mountain Loop Highway behind as it descends 300 feet down a steep bluff toward the Stillaguamish River. A series of gentle switchbacks makes the trip down (and back up) easy on the knees. The river bottom is wide and lush with maples and cottonwoods, making this an ideal place to soak your feet while soaking up the sun.<br><br>Paralleling the river, the trail begins to show signs of the flooding that made this stretch so problematic for workers more than a century ago; undercut banks and eroded trail are prevalent, but easily manageable for hikers today. The roar of the river soon rises as the water is funneled through narrowing canyon walls, creating frothy rapids and churning eddies. Here, too, is the first tangible evidence that a railroad once ran this way. Walking atop the old railroad ties, it is easy to imagine the mining days of yore and to conjure up images of rusty railroad cars chock-full of ore rolling down the bumpy tracks.<br><br>At 1.2 miles, a rockslide blocks the path, marking the official end of the trail, and once again confirming the difficulties that railroad engineers faced so long ago. Beyond the rockslide, the trail leads to several tunnels, but for now it is not safe to venture that far.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Despite its intermediate difficulty, Mount Pilchuck sees a slew of visitors in a given year, as hikers flock to the trail for its grand panoramic views and historic restored fire lookout. Easily one of the most rewarding hikes in the area, its relatively short 2.7 mile, 2,300 feet ascent gifts you 360-degree views of Mount Baker, Mount Rainier and the Olympics from its shelter lookout, which sits nestled on a summit that tops out around 5,300 feet. This calf-friendly journey is all made possible by a high elevation trailhead, which sets you off on your travels around 3,000 feet, cutting what would otherwise be an arduous ten mile roundtrip in half. <br><br>All these alluring elements also make Pilchuck one of the busiest hikes in the area, so expect company along the way. Catching the trail on a quiet day is ideal, but even on weekdays the fire lookout can take on hostel-like conditions as hikers gather and string up hammocks for overnight stays to enjoy sunrise views from the comfort of their swinging fabric havens. <br><br>Don&#x2019;t let Pilchuck&#x2019;s popularity fool you, however. Even with its heavy foot traffic and respectable grade, this peak should not be mistaken for a bunny hill. There are perilous elements, especially in winter, when snow may obscure the path, leading hikers to improvise and become lost. Hikers often have to be rescued from the mountain, so please take all the necessary precautions before tackling the trail. It is always encouraged that you check in with the ranger and sign the registry at the trailhead before starting your journey.<br><br>To begin, depart the trailhead and reach an immediate fork. The left trail is a false path, so steer right and get your feet wet crossing a stream, christening your journey up Mount Pilchuck. After about a quarter mile, you will see an &#x201C;entering Pilchuck State Park&#x201D; sign. It&apos;s seen better days, but it reaffirms your course and destination. There is sparse signage from this point on. It is not a particularly hazardous trail early on, but depending on the season, you could be dealing with rocky, snowy and wet conditions on the latter part of the trip, so be prepared for anything. Traction devices and poles are strongly encouraged if snow is present on the trail. <br><br>You will encounter a scree slope at the one-mile mark (the elevation marker should be about 3,500 feet for reference). Do not attempt to scramble upward. Instead, look for an orange marker that guide you left through the boulder field and lead you back to the defined trail. After another half mile, you will depart the forest and reach a clearing. Unless cloud cover is obscuring it, the fire lookout should be visible at the summit. Use this landmark as reference, as hikers have been known to gravitate toward false summits and place themselves in danger. <br><br>After snaking up the exposed slope, you will reach the cone of the summit. There should be a brown &#x201C;Parking Area&#x201D; sign on a tree pointing returning hikers back down the slope you have just hiked up. This will be the last vestige of signage before reaching the lookout. If you do not see this sign and are not confident of your whereabouts, it is possible that you have wandered toward one of the false summits. On the right trail, you will continue on, winding around the peak until you eventually reach the top of the mountain and its sublime restored fire lookout.  <br><br>Sit, eat and enjoy your time in the shelter. Originally constructed in 1921 (almost ten years after the first trail on the mountain was established), the fire lookout now stands today as a proud landmark for the area. The shelter has endured numerous renovations over the years and continues to be one of the most popular and in-demand lunch spots in Washington. Reservations are not necessary, however, as even on the busiest of days, spirits are high with summiters and the atmosphere is always welcoming and inclusive, even between large parties that camp out on the benches and outlying boulders. It&#x2019;s hard not to find a smiling face on top of this picturesque peak. A social mountain, indeed. And one that should not be missed.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: If you find the Pilchuck experience daunting, try the nearby Heather Lake trail instead. Its lower elevation journey may be the warm up you need before taking on the more demanding Pilchuck trail.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Here&apos;s an unusual hike through a very mossy forest and along a narrow river canyon, past sites that were important in local history. A railroad once ran along the canyon, passing through small communities. Logging was done in the area, and lime once was produced from limestone here, in a kiln that still stands. The railroad and communities are gone now, and much has disappeared over the past eighty years. But a few artifacts still remain and can be seen near the trail.<br><br>The trailhead and much of the hike lie within the Robe Canyon Historic Park. Information about the park, and historical photos, are presented on a two-sided bulletin board at the trailhead. It&apos;s good material, although some of the text is printed in a relatively small font size, and glare from plastic covering the photos can make viewing them a challenge in some lighting conditions.<br><br>The route begins with a gentle climb of about 200 feet, followed by a gradual loss of about 600 feet before reaching a longer, nearly-level section along an old railroad grade. In fact, most of the elevation gain occurs on the return hike. The route crosses both public and private land, and the footing varies from old road beds to narrow, stony trail. There are numerous signs along the way, so route-finding is not a problem.<br><br>Begin your hike in a forested area, with an exuberant growth of ferns below. Then venture out onto a former road that traverses private property. In late summer, you may find a few ripe blackberries - not the native variety - beside the trail. The route leaves the road and heads downhill on a narrow, stony path passing close to Hubbard Pond. But the undergrowth near the trail is quite dense and you may have difficulty seeing the water.<br><br>The route widens again, crosses a sturdy bridge and continues along another old road before turning left onto a narrow trail and heading downhill. You will hear the sounds of a creek off to the left, hidden beneath a lot of vegetation. The sound of flowing water increases as you approach the South Fork of the Stillaguamish, where the trail meets and continues along the former railroad grade.<br><br>Signs along the grade offer bits of history, including the route and dates of the Everett and Monte Cristo Railroad, the location of the former community of Cutoff Junction, and the site of a former logging spur railroad. Artifacts of various kinds appear near the trail. Some are easily identified, including remnants of a cast iron stove, broken pieces of rotary saw blades, old bricks, and a bent length of steel rail. Many of these items are quite photogenic. Feel free to take photos, but please leave the artifacts for future hikers to enjoy. <br><br>At one point the trail turns up a side canyon, climbs just a few feet, then crosses to the other side. Soon, the lime kiln looms up rather abruptly on the right, a short way off the trail. It&apos;s about 20 feet tall, with considerable moss and ferns adorning the sides. The overall form of the kiln and the shape of the arch on the side first seen from the trail, combined with the very green mossy surroundings, invite comparisons to a Mayan jungle ruin.<br><br>The kiln was built in the 1890s and used until the early 1930s to convert local limestone into &quot;lime,&quot; i.e. calcium oxide. The product was transported by the adjoining railroad, mostly for use as a &quot;flux&quot; to promote melting of ores in smelters in the Everett area. The limestone apparently was loaded into the open top of the kiln from carts that approached from the uphill side. Unfortunately, none of the loading structure remains. The kiln has stoking ports on three sides where fires would have been tended--gathering sufficient dry wood as fuel in this very moist area must have presented a challenge!<br><br>Beyond the kiln, the trail follows the railroad grade upstream another 0.7 miles, where a sign directs hikers left for the 0.2 mile &quot;River Shore Loop,&quot; or right for the &quot;Railroad Bridge Site and End of Trail.&quot; Actually, you can go either way. Each branch of the trail loops back on the other, and part way around the loop there is a signed side trail that leads 150 feet to the site of the former bridge that once crossed the Stillaguamish, though nothing now remains of the bridge.<br><br>The loop trail does descend to the stony river bank for a close-up view of the water. In late summer or early fall the water level is low, the river flow is calm, and a bit of sandy beach may be exposed. But in winter or early spring the river can become a torrent and should be approached cautiously.</p>\n                 ",

The trail is heavily traveled in the summer, but winter visitors will find the crowds thin and the forests even more beautiful when blanketed in soft white. The lake features several excellent campsites around its perimeter, each with its own charm and glorious view of Mount Pilchuck or the Stillaguamish Valley. The short distance makes this a great destination to consider for first-timers in the art of winter camping.<br><br>The trail leaves the left side of the parking area near the gate and immediately begins climbing through the dense young forest, switching back a time or two before traversing west into the Heather Creek valley. The trail climbs steadily alongside the creek, gaining more than 1000 feet in the 2 miles to the lake. After nearly a mile of climbing, notice how the surrounding forest begins to age. Old, stout trees of massive size are mingled with the young, crowded stands of second-growth fir and hemlock. At the 1.2-mile mark, the forest is entirely old growth, with ancient hulks towering over the trail and long-dead trunks lying scattered about the forest floor. The decaying fallen trees provide just the rich nourishment seeds need to sprout and grow into young, upstart trees. In this way, the dead trees, or nurse logs, hold the roots of a new generation, closing the circle of forest life. Even buried under snow, these nurse logs are evident. Just look for the long rows of young trees, and imagine them all rooted in one long, straight log. <br><br>The trail reaches the Heather Lake basin at just above 2400 feet and breaks out of the forest and into open views of the towering summit of Mount Pilchuck beyond. The lake is at a low enough elevation that at no time should you attempt to cross its ice; the ice is seldom thick enough to support an adult, and even then, it is likely riddled with cracks and fissures, which could open and send you into a quick bout of hypothermia.<br><br>Campsites can be found around the perimeter of the lake, and the best are on the eastern shore where the slope is most gradual and the view most splendid.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful.

With just a bit more elevation gain, and slightly more rugged terrain, it&apos;s the perfect place to take children on their first &#x2018;real&#x2019; hike. The trail is short, but just steep and challenging enough to give a child a real sense of accomplishment once they reach the lake. The lake itself is a scenic little lake located on the northeastern slope of Mount Pilchuck. <br><br>The trail takes off just left of the large parking lot, and immediately begins to climb through old second growth forest on a series of switchbacks. As you climb through the woods, note the huge rotting stumps with the springboard notches on the side. Springboards were boards placed in tree trunks for the loggers of yore to stand on as they used a large crosscut saw to take down the tree. Notice young trees growing out of the stumps--old stumps nursing new forest. <br><br>The trail reaches an old logging road, and follows it for a short distance before it begins to climb again. At this point the trail becomes very rocky and rooty and in high runoff, wet, with little streamlets running through the rocks. Watch for little waterfalls along the way. <br><br>The vegetation becomes more interesting as the trail climbs. Admire from the trail the large prickly leaves and bright red berries of devils club and fern understory. You will reach a clearing in the woods as the trail takes a slight bend. After crossing the clearing, look for the wide, spreading roots of a long ago downed tree on your right. The soil has since been packed hard here by many small feet (and some big ones) posing for pictures. <br><br>As you continue to climb through the forest again, notice the big old-growth trees that escaped the saws of days past. Give them a hug, then cross another small clearing, and soon the trail begins to level out. Only another quarter of a mile to go and you will be at the lake. The ground is marshy and the trail muddy, but there is a nice boardwalk across some of this. In spring the marsh will be bright yellow with the large showy flowers of skunk cabbage. You will glimpse the lake, but just before you reach it, there is a fork in the trail. The trail goes all around the lake so it really doesn&#x2019;t matter which direction you choose, you will only add a little over half a mile. <br><br>The right fork crosses a series of boardwalks through the woods, and then on to some fine lunch rocks on the far side of the lake. The trail left follows the shore past some nice camp spots along the water. On the east side of the lake there is an open marshy area. You will find a succession of wildflowers here, starting with the marsh marigolds and trillium and ending with fall asters. <br><br>Notice the contorted mountain hemlock along this section of the trail, and speculate on what caused it to grow that way. There is also more boardwalk here that passes by a quiet little pond with some reflection picture opportunities, and nice views of Mount Pilchuck. <br><br>On your way back, as you pass the outlet stream, notice all the berry bushes and make a note to revisit this little gem of a lake in the fall!  <br><br>Pro Tip: This is a very popular hike on sunny weekends. Visit midweek, pack breakfast and a thermos of coffee, get there before nine, and have the lake to yourself.</p>\n                 ",

That&apos;s their mistake. Mount Pilchuck offers several miles of gently climbing trail that follows the winding road leading to the summer trailhead parking area. Farther up the trail, adventurous snowshoers can forsake the roadway and hike up through the trees or along the wide runs of an abandoned downhill ski area. The alpine skiers swarmed here in the 1970s, but the resort failed after just a few years, leaving broad slopes for snowshoers to climb and telemark skiers to swoosh down. From the top of the runs, the Stillaguamish River valley--including the deep, dark cut of Robe Gorge--sprawls below, while the jagged top of Pilchuck looms overhead.<br><br>The vehicle gate marks the end of all legal motorized traffic, so after snowshoeing around it, enter a world of default wilderness. The road climbs steadily but not too steeply along its first 2 miles. Off-road rambling isn&apos;t recommended in this early stage, but about 3.5 miles up the trail--just after crossing a small stream--there is an opportunity in heavy snow years to angle up through the trees to the left, cutting across the neck of a wide switchback. This will require some routefinding skills because there is no true trail. However, the trees are widely spaced enough that, if the undergrowth is buried in enough snow, you can simply climb between them. <br><br>If you prefer to keep things simple and serene, continue around on the road. At just over 4 miles, the road switches back to the left. A half mile farther up the route, the road turns back to the right, but if the snow is stable and avalanche dangers are minimal, a better option awaits. From the corner of the second switchback, head straight out toward the southeast in a climbing traverse of the snowy slope on the flank of Pilchuck. In less than 0.5 mile, the first open run of the old ski area is encountered. Climb up this wide trail, sticking to the edge near the trees to avoid a nasty confrontation (i.e., collision) with backcountry skiers practicing their telemark turns on the open slopes. <br><br>By using this steep, direct approach, the climb to the top is more of a workout, but it cuts nearly a mile off the road distance. It will also get you to the top before the crowds of skiers can kick their way up the road. That means more time at the top--the end of the road and the site of the old ski lodge--to enjoy the views alone and uninterrupted. The lodge is long gone, but the views of the Stillaguamish River valley and the high, serrated ridges above it are as beautiful as ever. <br><br>If you have a mountaineering background and advanced avalanche-recognition skills, you might consider climbing part way up the Mount Pilchuck Trail. The route is steep and difficult to find as it winds its way up through forests, rocky slopes, and dangerous avalanche chutes. This added adventure isn&apos;t for the fainthearted or the untested--summer hikers often get lost here.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Easiest to More Difficult<br>Generally good trails for beginners, with moderate elevation change and minimal avalanche danger.\n                 ",

From this notch of a pass high in the Chiwawa Mountains, stand mesmerized, frozen in awe, utterly fixated on the mystifying and alluring Napeequa Valley. Gaze down at the wild Napeequa River, slithering and shining in this classic U-shaped valley, flanked by ice and rock and carpeted in vivid greenery speckled with brilliant wildflowers.<br><br>From beginning to end, there&apos;s nothing easy about this trail. The first challenge is met immediately at the trailhead with a ford of the Chiwawa River. A bridge once spanned the river here, but it was swept away by a furious flood back in 1972. Respect the river. It can only be safely forded in late summer when water levels run low. Even then it&apos;s still cold and the current swift, so proceed with caution. If it looks scary, head instead to one of the many other excellent hikes nearby in the Chiwawa Valley.<br><br>Picking your way across the graveled river, scan the cold waters for chinook, steelhead, and trout: cutthroat, rainbow, perhaps even bull. A car campground once existed here on the west bank of the river, but very little evidence of it remains. You&apos;ll need to snoop around a little to locate the trail. Head north a short way to a grove of mature cottonwoods, and then turn left at a rocky outwash where good, discernable tread can eventually be found.<br><br>The trail, once an old sheep drive, parallels Maple Creek for a short distance before crossing its wide gravelly wash. Now paralleling the watercourse on its north bank, the trail gently climbs under a canopy of scraggly hemlocks occasionally interspersed with white pine. Easy wanderings, however, end soon and the way turns steep and rough. Receiving little maintenance, this trail is in danger of becoming yet another casualty of Forest Service neglect (thanks largely to congressional indifference). Expect brushy sections, a lot of windfall, and areas of slumping tread.<br><br>After 2 miles of steep climbing, the way rounds a ridge (elev. 4200 ft), leaving the Maple Creek valley for the Little Giant Creek valley. Now in a cool forested grove, drop steeply 200 feet to cross a branch of Little Giant Creek (which can be tricky). The trail, now downright nasty, ascends steep slopes of fire-charred forest. After crossing a minor tributary, fight through a curse-inducing patch of spirea and slide alder before emerging onto open ledges-and, thankfully, to good views out across the Chiwawa Valley to the Entiat Mountains.<br><br>Work your way up the sun-kissed ledges. Then unfortunately, it&apos;s back into the brush before reaching soothing heather and blueberry meadows blessed with a myriad of flowers and gently gurgling rivulets. Your toil now finally validated, the way continues up an open knoll (elev. 5700 ft) offering superb viewing north to the fortress of peaks at the head of the Chiwawa Valley.<br><br>After one last steep grunt, the trail makes a long switchback through sweeping alpine meadows to the 6409-foot pass on Chiwawa Ridge. While the views so far have been <br><br>excellent, they pale compared to what you are about to experience. Climb the small knoll just to the north of the pass and behold the unveiling of one of the most stunning views this side of the Continental Divide. Stare straight down to the snaking Napeequa (which means &quot;white water&quot;), the river slithering through fields of green beneath towering peaks topped in ice that glistens in the sun. Clark, Glacier, Buck, and scores of lesser-but just as beautiful and impres-sive-peaks will keep you mesmerized and captivated all afternoon long.<br><br>The trail continues into the magical valley, but the added distance, elevation change, and degree of difficulty of the path puts it squarely into the realm of the experienced backpacker.</p>\n                 ",

Take five days (or seven!) and enjoy some of the best backcountry in the state. Along the way, you&apos;ll see massive wildflower meadows, glaciers, alpine lakes, high mountain passes and supreme views of Glacier Peak.<br><br>Start along the popular Spider Meadow-Phelps Creek trail (also written up here as a dayhike). Follow Phelps Creek for a long, but relatively easy 5 miles to the mile-long expanse of Spider Meadow. This is a favorite destination of weekend backpackers, so you may wish to camp further along - either in Phelps Basin at the far end of the meadow or in one of the camps near the tarns at the base of Spider Glacier.<br><br>At the end of Spider Meadow, choose the steep trail to the left to ascend to Upper Lyman Lakes. It&apos;s steep, but it&apos;s just a warm-up for the most harrowing part of the loop. Bringing trekking poles or an ice axe is highly recommended for climbing up Spider Glacier (if the snow has melted out, you can also pick your way to the right of the glacier over rocks) to Spider Gap (your high point at 7100 ft).<br><br>There is a boot-beaten path from the Gap as you head down to Upper Lyman Lakes, which can be quite treacherous when snow or ice-covered. Make sure to time your trip late enough in the summer to make it down safely - or turn around at Spider Gap.<br><br>There are plenty of campsites around Lyman Lake (elev. 5500 feet), and it provides a good basecamp for exploring the area. Take short sidetrips to Lyman Falls or hike down the trail to large Hart Lake and relax on its pebbly shore. Or push on -- there&apos;s still plenty to see on the loop. Cloudy Pass is another 1.5 miles past Lower Lyman Lake, and Suiattle Pass another mile beyond that. Note that water may be limited in this area late in summer, so be sure to stock up at Lyman Lakes. <br><br>By the time you reach Suiattle Pass, the views have really opened up. Enjoy in-your-face views of the wilderness around you, especially of the mountain it&apos;s named for, Glacier Peak. At the pass, you join with the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) for a few miles of sensory overload. One sidetrip to seriously consider is Image Lake. While it&apos;s about a 7-mile roundtrip detour, the path and the destination are completely worth it. Photographers from far and wide have been known to make the trek to Image Lake to capture Glacier Peak reflected in its calm waters. <br><br>Whether you take the detour or save Image Lake for another day, continue on the loop, following the PCT and crossing Miners Creek until you reach a junction with Trail 789, which leads to Buck Creek Pass. You&apos;ll be tempted again with sidetrips up Middle Ridge and Flower Dome, both worthy destinations. <br><br>After exploring Buck Creek Pass, it&apos;s a long 9.6 miles back to the trailhead near the Phelps Creek Campground and another three miles along the roadback to your car.</p>\n                 ",

But don&apos;t expect solitude, for Spider Meadow crawls with backpackers-brigades of them! The valley is large enough to disperse in, though, and Phelps Basin offers a quiet retreat from the meadow&apos;s loungers and shutterbugs and their tent cities.<br><br>The number of vehicles at the trailhead should give you a good indication of the popularity of this hike. Spider Meadow is one of the busiest places within the Glacier Peak Wilderness.<br><br>Head down the Phelps Creek Trail, an old road reverting nicely to trail. In 0.25 mile, after hopping across a refreshing creek, come to the junction with the Carne Mountain Trail. Continue straight, traversing pleasant forest and crossing several side creeks, entering the Glacier Peak Wilderness at 2.5 miles.<br><br>Continuing along Phelps Creek, the delightful trail marches gently up the valley. Pass through groves of big Engelmann spruce and by tailings of old mines. The area is littered with old mines, and a few doughty prospectors still work claims in the vicinity. At 3.4 miles cross Leroy Creek, which may be tricky in periods of high runoff. On the north side of the creek you may notice a trail taking off right. This is the start of the Leroy High Route, a challenging alpine route through the Entiat Mountains.<br><br>About a mile beyond Leroy, the trail actually takes a noticeable ascent, but still quite gentle, mind you. At just over 5 miles, break out from the trees to the edge of Spider Meadow (elev. 4750 ft). Now behold the beauty of an open U-shaped valley carpeted in brilliant wildflowers. Look up to 7646-foot Red Mountain, its rusty summit contrasting nicely with its necklace of snow patches. You can call it quits here, finding a nice place to lounge by Phelps Creek, or continue farther to more dramatic scenery.<br><br>The trail carries on, blazing right up the middle of the sprawling meadows. At 5.5 miles it crosses a side creek and then climbs through a cluster of firs and enters an upper meadow. Stare up at cascading creeks coming down off of Red Mountain and Phelps Ridge. Now hop across Phelps Creek, after which the trail steepens and reenters forest. At just over 6 miles reach a signed junction. The trail left climbs to Spider Gap en route to the Lyman Lakes-it&apos;s where all of the backpackers are heading.<br><br>Hang a right on the path less taken, and in less than 0.5 mile reach the head of the wide-open cirque called Phelps Basin (elev. 5400 ft). It&apos;s quite a dramatic spot, hemmed in by the vertical walls of 8421-foot Dumbell Mountain. Melting snowfields give birth to Phelps Creek here, where it tumbles through vibrant clusters of violet monkey flowers. Notice that you have the whole basin to your-self.

And valleys too! Peer straight down into gorgeous emerald allies housing roaring waterways. The trail is well built, albeit steep. An excellent alpine choice in early summer-come for the wildflowers. Or miss the floral show and arrive later for the larch production, which receives golden praise year after year.<br><br>Carne Mountain was named by A. H. Sylvester for an English clergyman and is pronounced carn, not carnay, as in the Spanish word for meat-though you may feel like raw meat after attempting this steep, south-facing climb on a hot summer day. So get an early start to avoid the heat. Take a siesta on the summit and savor the scenery.<br><br>Starting from the Phelps Creek trailhead, don&apos;t despair if the parking lot is overflowing all the way down to Trinity (more on Trinity later). Ninety percent of those vehicles belong to hikers heading to Spider Meadow. Head down the Phelps Creek Trail a quick 0.25 mile, hopping over a refreshing creek just before coming to the junction with the Carne Mountain Trail. Time to break a sweat: the trail immediately commences to climb, switchbacking at times, shooting straight up at others.<br><br>As you wind through open forest, peek-a-boo views hint at the visual pleasures that lie ahead. After close to 2 miles of serious climbing, break out onto dry open slopes. While your eyes may be lured to scan the valley below, the myriad flowers painting the hillside may capture your attention first. Continue climbing at a good clip, passing a spur to a creekside campsite before reaching a series of tight switchbacks, views growing at each twist of the trail.<br><br>At 3 miles enter a high hanging basin (elev. 6100 ft) laced in larch and brushed with brilliant blossoms. Snow lingers late in this alpine pocket, providing a reliable water source for resident marmots and parched hikers. After a much needed respite from climbing, it&apos;s steeply up, up, and away once more. Soon reach a junction with the lightly traveled Old Gib Trail (elev. 6450 ft).<br><br>Head left, ascending through attractive groves of larches to crest a high saddle (elev. 6800 ft) between Carne&apos;s two prominent summits, coming to an unsigned junction with the Rock Creek Trail.

Speedwell, buckwheat, gilia, gentian, lupine, paintbrush, partridgefoot, stonecrop, penstemon, buttercup, anemone, aster-what a line-up!<br><br>The panorama of pointy peaks and deep valleys is quite an arrangement as well. South it&apos;s the wild and lonely Rock Creek valley flanked by the Entiat Mountains, Old Gib, and Basalt. Look west to Buck and the Chiwawa Ridge, their glaciers and snowfields glistening in the sun. Directly below, make out remnant structures of Trinity, a former mining town, now a private ghost town. Stare north for the finale-straight up the Phelps Creek basin to its imposing watchmen: Fortress, Chiwawa, Red, Dumbell, Sevenfingered Jack, and then there&apos;s Maude! At 9082 feet, Washington&apos;s thirteenth-highest summit steals the show.</p>\n                 ",

All the best--and some of the worst--aspects of snowshoeing are found here. Wide, wonderful panoramic views; alpine meadows of rolling snowdrifts; frosted evergreens and dark, brooding forests; and occasionally, frigid, scouring winds that blind all visitors with white-out conditions. <br><br>Hurricane Ridge, and the snowshoe hike to Hurricane Hill, offers the best views in the park of majestic Mount Olympus. The peak so captivated early explorers with its beauty that the mountain was deemed worthy of being home to the gods.<br><br>Heading west from the lodge, snowshoe along the roadway as it rolls around the flank of the Hurricane Ridge meadows. The road soon enters forest and drops gently with the ridge for nearly a mile. The trail levels out along a high saddle, passing a broad picnic area near the end of the road. A brief climb from the picnic area takes you to the end of the road at 1.5 miles. At this point the real snowshoeing work begins.

The trail stays on the west side of the ridge, passing under two tricky avalanche chutes. Snowshoers will do better to merely stick to the narrow (sometimes, knife-edged) ridge crest all the way to the top. If the snow is heavily crusted or icy, even snowshoes with heavy cleats will not be enough to ensure safe footing, so come prepared to turn around before reaching the true summit of Hurricane Hill.<br><br>Even if the top isn&apos;t reached, the views are spectacular all along the trail. To the north, the Strait of Juan de Fuca is a dark blue ribbon between the Olympic foothills and the far shore of Canada&apos;s Vancouver Island. Northeast, the San Juan Islands are seen cradled in the calm, blue waters of upper Puget Sound, with Mount Baker rearing its icy head beyond. To the east, Mount Angeles and McCarthy Peak jut up at the far side of the Olympic Mountains. To the south, Mount Olympus reigns supreme, dominating the impressive Bailey Range. <br><br>There is beauty to behold in every direction. But there is also the possibility of danger. Weather on Hurricane Ridge is unpredictable and prone to rapid changes. Come prepared for a variety of conditions--sunny days can quickly fade into heavy fog and frigid temperatures. Calm weather can give way, in just minutes, to heavy winds and white-out conditions.

From this point, known as First Top, enjoy first-rate views that encompass snowy Mount Olympus all the way to salty Pillar Point on the Strait of Juan de Fuca. And gracing this heavenly haven on the mountain of angels are delightful rock gardens and fields of blooming heather. Divine, yes, but it&apos;s a devil of a climb!<br><br>The trail starts from the west end of the parking lot. If any cars are parked here, chances are the occupants are on the adjacent Lake Angeles Trail. It&apos;s a tough hike to Heather Park, but the trail is in good shape. You will be too after tackling this hike.<br><br>Start through a uniform forest of second-growth Doug-fir. The original forest burned in the early twentieth century thanks to homesteaders who didn&apos;t heed Smokey&apos;s sound advice. Through a thick understory, the trail steadily climbs, at times steeply. At 2 miles pass Halfway Rock, a glacial erratic marking the not-quite-midway point to Heather Park. The trail eases somewhat before launching into more switchbacks.<br><br>Now skirting along the northeast slope of First Top, a thinning forest reveals glimpses of the amazing views that await you at the summit. Craggy Second Top hovers ahead. The trail soon breaks out into the open, snaking steeply around basalt ledges bursting with blossoming wildflowers.<br><br>At 4.2 miles the way levels out, entering a small basin (elev. 5300 ft) tucked between First and Second Tops. This is the beginning of Heather Park, a subalpine bowl of flowers, boulders, heather, and stunted evergreens. Come upon a small creek before making a final climb to wind-blasted and sun-baked Heather Pass. Piper&apos;s bluebell, cinquefoil, and Olympic onion add colorful touches to the drab shale and scree littering the pass.<br><br>The view is amazing. But it&apos;s better from First Top, 100 feet higher and reached by following a small way path just to the right. From this basaltic shoulder of Mount Angeles, gaze out in every direction for supreme viewing. Port Angeles and the Strait of Juan de Fuca lie to the north 1 vertical mile below. To the east, follow the strait to islands flanked by snowcapped peaks. To the west, follow the strait as it parts the peninsula from Vancouver Island and leads to the Pacific. And to the south, take in Mount Angeles, Hurricane Hill, the Bailey Range, Mount Appleton, and Snider Ridge-all under Mount Olympus&apos;s watchful eye.\n                 ",

But when it comes to alpine lakes, the park seems lacking. Sure, scores of aquatic gems sparkle in the backcountry, but compared to the Cascades, the Olympics come up short. Lake-loving day hikers need not shy away, however, for there are a handful of attainable alpine gems. Lake Angeles is one of them. It&apos;s also one of the largest lakes in the Olympics, and the most popular.<br><br>From high above on Klahhane Ridge, 20-acre Lake Angeles looks like a teardrop. Occupying a glacial cirque, the lake is ringed on three sides by steep rocky walls. Through most of the summer, tumbling creeks of snowmelt feed the isolated body of water. A small island formed by rockfall and adorned with subalpine firs sits in the middle of the emerald lake.<br><br>Beautifully set, Lake Angeles is well-loved by hikers from near and far. The boot-beaten path to its shores attests to this. But this is not an easy hike-the trail gains over 2300 feet in 3.5 miles. Well-shaded, however, you shouldn&apos;t have any trouble overheating while grunting to your objective.<br><br>The well-worn path immediately sets out climbing, paralleling Ennis Creek, before making a sharp turn east and heading over to another creek drainage. The trail then makes a sharp turn back west, crosses the creek, and begins to climb straight up a rib, the divide between Ennis and Lake Creeks. Never easing up, the trail works its way into the deep cirque housing the lake.<br><br>At 3.7 miles a sign indicates the lake is near. Turn left down a short spur and behold, Lake Angeles. Cool air rushes down the bare slopes above, rippling the lake surface. Sunlight twinkles off of the small waves. It&apos;s a soothing scene, but you won&apos;t be alone here. You&apos;ve earned the right to find a nice spot, however, to enjoy this Olympic aquatic gem.\n                 ",

At 10.4 miles, it can be either a day-hike or a quick early season overnight. You won&#x2019;t be alone, though &#x2013; this is a popular trail with both hikers and backpackers.<br><br>The trail starts at the far end of the large parking lot.

Consider taking one trail to the lake, and the other one on the trip back to your car.<br><br>The trail to the right drops down to the creek.  You will be on a twisty trail surrounded by conifers, alders, ferns and skunk cabbage. The first mile or so is close enough to hear the creek and periodically enjoy peek-a-boo views of it. The tread is soft, and the stream crossings are small with stepping stones that may be partially submerged in the early season.<br><br>The trail to the left follows an old road. It is straight and wide, with a mild but constant uphill and then downhill grade. The trail consists of an old layer of packed gravel, and is lined with alders. Stream crossings are more difficult early season, but still manageable. There is an eroded culvert in one of the streams that is a little tricky to navigate, so take it slow and if you feel unsafe, don&apos;t go beyond your ability level. <br><br>If you opt for the upper trail views along the way will be of jagged peaks, two really nice waterfalls, small patches of wild strawberries, and lots of bleeding hearts. Be sure to avoid the Chokwich Creek Trail, which branches off to your left at 3.6 miles from the trailhead. On the trip back to the trailhead, you might not even notice this junction.<br><br>Shortly after the trails rejoin, the way gets a little rocky and the grade steepens. As you switchback up the hillside, keep your eyes and ears open for a large waterfall on your right. Continuing uphill, arrive at the root-ball of a large fallen tree. The trail switchbacks to the left here, but the adventurous will want to take a quick side trip to the right. There was once an old wood-planked road here and a bridge across the river to an old town site. The bridge is gone, but there is still a rushing waterfall worth visiting. You&#x2019;ll have to contend with some fallen trees, but none of them are too bad.<br><br>After a bit more climbing, reach a well-signed junction just before the lake.  The campsites and two open-air privies are to the left. There are at least 15 sites here, though none of them are particularly private. The forest is open and the camp resembles a terraced hillside. <br><br>The trail to the lake continues to the right. After a short distance, arrive at a signed day-use area. This is your best bet for a lunch overlooking the lake, or for letting your kids run around. Even though the trail is popular, there is some room to spread out here.</p>\n                 ",

Five grand military installations originally established to protect Puget Sound from foreign invaders are now peaceful idylls: wit-ness Forts Ebey, Casey, Worden, Townsend, and Flagler. Fortunately, they never saw combat. Fortunate, too, that with their decommissioning in the 1950s they were converted to state parks that now protect over 2300 acres and 9 miles of prime Puget Sound coastline. At 780 acres, Fort Flagler on the northern tip of Marrowstone Island is the largest, consisting of over 3.5 miles of shoreline. It offers one of the finest beach hikes in the state. And if that isn&apos;t enough, there are miles of trails weaving through quiet forest and historic grounds to keep you more than content.<br><br>With over 7 miles of trail and 3.5 miles of coastline, hiking options are many at Fort Flagler. The following loop samples a few of the many facets of this wonderful seaside park. You&apos;ll walk on a wide beach with sweeping views out to islands, mountains, bays, and inlets. And you&apos;ll walk upon towering bluffs graced with stately trees and harboring relics that tell a century&apos;s worth of stories about life at Fort Flagler. Throw in some seabirds, frolicking deer and rabbits, and a surprise or two and you&apos;ve got yourself quite a hiking lineup to look forward to.<br><br>Start your adventure on the wide cobblestone-strewn beach. Head east, enjoying a grand view across Port Townsend Bay to the Victorian city of Port Townsend. Admire Whidbey Island&apos;s lofty chalky bluffs hovering in the distance. An impressive fortress of bluffs soon begins to tower right above you as well. Gaze up at the tall trees teetering on them-there&apos;s a good chance a bald eagle or two will be peering down at you. After 1.5 miles of beach strolling, round Marrowstone Point. Enjoy a knock-out view of Admiralty Inlet with its flotilla of vessels plying choppy waters.<br><br>Continue hiking on a wide sandy beach, coming to an old weather-battered pier at 2.25 miles. It&apos;s time now to sample Flagler&apos;s interior. Find the trail leading from the beach 0.25 mile to the Battery Wansboro, perched high on a bluff. Via a series of short interconnecting trails, work your way back to your starting point. Follow the Lagoon Trail for 0.5 mile to the East Searchlight Trail. Turn right, proceeding 0.5 mile to the Anti-Aircraft Battery Trail. Then continue 0.7 mile to the Bankhead Trail, turning left, for an 0.8-mile hike back to your vehicle.<br><br>En route you&apos;ll pass a handful of historic structures and pass through quiet groves of fir, cedar, maple, and alder.

Best of all, though, a 2-day trip means watching the sun set in a blaze of midwinter glory and, come morning, watching it rise anew over the orange-dappled peaks of the North Cascades.<br><br>Loads of recreationists are usually on the Schweitzer Creek Road system: Skiers love it because of the scenic beauty of the area. Snowmobilers like it because of the wide roadways and loop possibilities. Snowshoers will love it because of the opportunities to share in the beauty of the area on the gentle trails before leaving the hordes behind and venturing out into the seldom-visited splendor of the narrow trail to the lakes.<br><br>To begin the snowshoe trek, walk up the gently climbing Schweitzer Creek Road as it ascends a ridge face above its namesake creek. The road pierces the old, moss-laden forests of the valley bottom and climbs into increasingly young second-growth forest. After 2.5 miles, the scenery picks up and the views increase. The forests give way to open meadows (i.e., clearcuts) that spread like downy white quilts upon the hillside. Beyond these pillowy white meadows stretch the ragged crests of the Mountain Loop peaks: Three Fingers, Big Four, and Vesper Peak all scratch the sky on the far side of the Stillaguamish Valley to the east. <br><br>The road splits at just over 2.5 miles. Stay left on the main road as it rolls east around a small, rounded hilltop. (A right turn leads to Route 24, Bear Lake.) The route along this section pierces second-growth forests of Douglas fir, with occasional breaks of sunshine as it crosses clearcut meadows. Stay to the edges of the road along here, as snowmobilers tend to increase their speed on the long, straight stretches. <br><br>Five miles from the parking area at the base of the hill, the road sweeps right through a hairpin corner. A couple hundred yards past the apex of the turn, find the Boardman Lake trailhead on the left. This hiking trail climbs gently for just under a mile, passing Lake Evan after a mere 100 yards, before continuing on into increasingly old forest. The trail climbs steadily from Lake Evan but gains just 200 feet along the way. The trail is fairly easy to follow, even in heavy snow years, but if you lose it in the trees, simply head due south, climbing straight up the slope to reach the northern end of Boardman.<br><br>The trail crosses the lake&apos;s outlet stream immediately upon reaching the lake. This area can be a bit tricky because of the jumble of logs clogging the neck of the outlet stream. The debris allows you to keep your feet dry while crossing, but the odd angles of the many logs can make footing precarious at times. Use care when stepping over the logs, and the crossing can be accomplished without undue difficulty.<br><br>Once across, enjoy the views of the ice-covered lake and distant vistas. To the east, Mallardy Ridge lines the sky. To the north, Boardman Creek leads down into the Stillaguamish Valley, and beyond that are the high peaks of Three Fingers, Big Bear Mountain, and Liberty Mountain. To the south, Bald Mountain rises over the lake basin. Good campsites are located along the eastern shore of the lake for those planning to stay and enjoy the beautiful basin at sunset and sunrise.<br><br>To return home, head back down the narrow forest trail to its junction with the road. From there, go right to retrace your steps, or head left and make a loop of the trip. Going this way, the road descends more than a mile, crossing a clearcut and young stands of second-growth timber. About 1.25 miles from the Lake Boardman trailhead, the road banks right--a blue-diamond blaze on the trees nearby indicates a trail. Continue straight ahead along this connector trail to reach the narrow bed of FR 4021. Stay right on this new road, and follow it down 2 miles to a junction with FR 4020. Go left and walk the last 2 miles out to the junction with the Mountain Loop Highway.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.).

Just under a mile and gaining a mere 250 feet of elevation along the way (and 50 on the way back), this lovely backcountry body of water can be reached by just about every hiker-young and old, long-legged and short-breathed, and everyone else in between.<br><br>While it&apos;ll take most hikers a mere thirty minutes to reach this delightful destination, allow yourself a good half day to fully enjoy and appreciate the lake and its environs. Boardman is an ideal place for acquainting children with the wonders of nature. Its shimmering waters invite lounging, feet soaking, and, during the dog days of summer, perhaps even a quick dip.<br><br>Even the trail itself will captivate young minds.

Surrounded by timbered and rocky knolls, brushy talus slopes, and primeval forest, the lake feels like it&apos;s deep in the wilderness. There are plenty of good spots for sunning, soaking, and fishing.<br><br>You can cross the outlet creek on a logjam and explore a forested bluff on the lake&apos;s eastern shore. A handful of tidy campsites perfect for neophyte backpackers occupy the area. A primitive path continues but, like the one on the northern lakeshore, it peters out in brushy and marshy terrain.<br><br>While Boardman is a fairly popular place on a sunny weekend afternoon, it&apos;s a large enough locale to accommodate all guests.

After a slight climb, at 1.2 miles leave the old road for real trail, the old cut for real forest.<br><br>On boardwalks, puncheon, and circular cedar crosscuts, the trail traverses a forest floor full of running and stored water. The Mount Pilchuck NRCA is among the wettest regions in the Cascades, receiving between 100 and 180 inches of annual precipitation, including heavy snowfall. Consequently, the area supports an abundance of plants and ecological zones more common to nearby higher elevations. While the trail has been constructed well, take care on all planking.

There are just enough sections of decent trail to reassure you that you&apos;re still on one. Keep a map handy so you don&apos;t get sidetracked by deceptive way trails that deadend in a jumble of brush. Once you reach the top of the ridge, you should be able to see Three Fingered Jack, Glacier Peak, and the tip of Mount Baker through the trees. Look over the ridge for a view of Bear Lake below you. The trail straightens out, passing through a couple of large mudholes, where early in the season there may be snow.  <br><br>Soon you will reach a large tarn, sometimes mistaken for the lake by overeager hikers. It is pretty, but the actual lake is prettier, and larger. Follow the little stream that heads down from the tarn. The trail is still rough and you may find yourself picking your way through the huckleberries or hiking in the stream itself. What a good way to test those waterproof boots! But the lake lies ahead, with some nice lunch rocks waiting. <br><br>Once arriving at the lake, admire the spires of Mount Pilchuck, and notice how completely different the view from here is, compared to the one normally seen from the west side. There are plenty of places to sit and have a sandwich, but no level places to camp by the lake.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: This area is a maze of old logging roads, and signs get shot up frequently and may be illegible.

In winter the route lends itself to snowshoeing.<br><br>The origin of Lake Twentytwo&#x2019;s distinct name is uncertain, but a leading theory is that nineteenth-century railroad maps listed local creeks numerically; one particular creek and its source lake were assigned &#x201C;22.&#x201D; The name stuck, and in 1947 the 790-acre Lake Twenty Two Research Natural Area (RNA) was created, putting an end to logging and allowing future generations to appreciate the remaining old-growth cedars and hemlocks.<br><br>At the trailhead, set out on a well-maintained track that quickly becomes a mountain rainforest trail. Substantial effort has gone into building a trail that can withstand the perpetual beating from the arch-enemy of all trails, water. Gravel, turnpikes, stone steps, puncheon bridges, and more turnpikes make a sustainable trail surface possible. There is always &quot;water on trail&quot; here, but the dampness allows ferns and moss to flourish in the Mountain Loop rainforest, and provides a trail environment fascinating to little ones. <br><br>The trail climbs steadily through the forest of western hemlock, mountain hemlock, alder, and red cedar. Old-growth hemlock and cedar giants have managed to persist due to the RNA. Substantial segments of the lower trail cross active creekbeds, so plan on wearing footwear appropriate for fording small creeks. At 0.6 miles, there is a bridge crossing over Twentytwo Creek, giving your boots a break from keeping your feet dry. But the ample water supply keeps salmonberry, thimbleberry, bunchberry, arnica, and bleeding heart growing thick all along the way. You are never far from the rush of water, and several waterfalls are located close to the trail. <br><br>At 1.5 miles, leave the forest and climb a talus slope, where western columbine makes an appearance in the summer. This middle segment offers views of Whitehorse Mountain and Three Fingers on clear days. Trudging onward, reenter the forest at 2.1 miles. Shortly thereafter, the terrain takes on a wetland character, with skunk cabbage blooming in the spring. When you reach the bridge over Lake Twentytwo&apos;s outflow, you have traveled 2.7 miles through lush rainforest. Marvel at the sheer northern face of Mount Pilchuck, with its waterfalls and (sometimes) booming avalanches in winter and spring. Take in the reflections of rock, sky, and evergreens on the surface of a pristine alpine cirque.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Though it may seem like you can make a circuit of the lake, it&apos;s best not to attempt this.

Catch your breath not from climbing (although it&apos;s tough), but from watching a continuous reel of premiere showings starring glistening white Mount Olympus and deep-blue Lake Crescent. If that&apos;s not enough to slack your jaw, Mount Baker hovering over the Strait of Juan de Fuca will most certainly captivate you. Constructed in 1994, the Mount Muller Loop is one of the newest additions to our trail system and among the all-time supreme scenic high-country romps.<br><br>Back in 1975, Forest Service employee Molly Erickson was convinced that Mount Muller and Snider Ridge were the most beautiful places in the Forks Ranger District-and that someone should put a trail on them. Twenty years later, Erickson and a slew of her Forest Service compatriots did just that, designing and building over 20 miles of trail on the long northern ridge above the Sol Duc Valley.<br><br>These dedicated Forest Service workers not only built an amazing trail that delivers one stunning view after another; they named features along the way and dedicated meadows to each other, making hiking the loop a whole lot of fun. The trail is shared by equestrians and mountain bikers, but no need to worry about crowds. Your main concern should be carrying enough water-most of the way is bone dry.<br><br>Do the loop clockwise, tackling the steep climb early in the morning before the day heats up. Start in a dark damp glen housing Littleton Creek, your last sure water until Hutch Creek, 9 miles farther. The way starts off easy before reaching a series of switchbacks that climb 2000 feet in 2.5 miles. In early summer, twinflower lines the trail like rows of tiny street lights. As you climb you&apos;ll traverse acres of young forest interrupted by big charred stumps.<br><br>After 3 long uphill miles, crest the ridge (elev. 3200 ft). Here at Jim&apos;s Junction, a trail leads left 3.5 miles to Kloshe Nanitch, one goes straight 0.5 mile to FR 3040, and another goes right 2.5 miles to Mount Muller. Head right on an up-and-down ridgeline march across miles of meadows, drinking in panoramic perspectives of the U-shaped Sol Duc Valley.<br><br>After a short stroll through a stand of silver fir, come to a glorious viewpoint of the emerald wall, Aurora Ridge, and the massive snow and ice heap, Mount Olympus. Hikers not wishing to make the long loop may consider this point far enough. For those eating the whole enchilada, carry on. After climbing to 3400 feet in Millsap Meadow, the trail rapidly loses 400 feet, bottoming out in Thomas Gap before steeply regaining lost ground.<br><br>On an up-and-down course, pass through Millsap, Jasmine, Allison, and Markham Meadows. Marvel at their multitude of blossoming flowers: paintbrush, tiger lily, thistle, bleeding heart, vetch, star flower, hawkweed, daisy, bear grass, columbine, lupine, lace, strawberry, bunchberry, and queen&apos;s cup among them.<br><br>At 5.5 miles a side trail leads left for 0.1 mile to the semiforested 3748-foot summit of Mount Muller. Bag it. Now proceed on the main trail to another side path, this one leading right 0.1 mile to Panorama Point, a series of outcrops in a sea of meadows. If you think the view can&apos;t possibly get better, wait until you see Lake Crescent sparkling below. Like sentinels, Pyramid Mountain and Mount Storm King guard the pristine waters of the fjordlike lake.<br><br>After soaking up views and sunshine, continue up and down along the ridge crest, dashing behind ledges and undulating between forest and meadow. From Cahill&apos;s Overlook (at 7 miles), drop rapidly to Mosely Gap, a 2800-foot low point on the ridge. One last uphill struggle, and then begin a long descent back to the valley.<br><br>Take a break to check out Fouts Rock House, two giant boulders rubbing shoulders at 8.5 miles. A mile beyond, cross Hutch Creek, a good spot for refilling depleted water bottles. The final 3 miles are mostly uneventful, traversing forest on a mostly level route. Not very exciting after what you&apos;ve experienced, but a necessary price to pay for this satisfying journey.

It&apos;s a grueling grunt to the flower gardens and breathtaking belvederes of Pugh, but worth every calorie spent.<br><br>Consider the first 2.75 miles along the North Fork Entiat River a nice warm-up. The tread is smooth, the grade slight. Only a mere 300 feet of elevation are subdued. Hit the trail and immediately confront Crow Creek. Easy to cross late in the season, in July it&apos;s a foot soaker. At 1 mile come to South Pyramid Creek, easily negotiated via a bridge.

A side path takes off left to a campsite along the river. Take it if your water supply is low. Otherwise, head right and commence climbing. The way is steep and at times rough. Animal tracks are numerous in the soft pumiceous soils.

At 2.7 miles from the valley, reach the meadow-carpeted ridge crest (elev. 6500 ft).<br><br>Now on faint to practically nonexistent tread, head west, climbing a couple of hundred more feet to a larch- and whitebark pine-graced knoll.

Unfortunately, the land has fallen into disrepair and is rough going, though for the most part easy to follow. <br><br>Roots and rocks are the status quo, interrupted occasionally by gravel, making hikers marvel at the distance the trail crew covered to get it in. But if you brave the trail and pack enough bug spray, you&#x2019;ll be rewarded with a visit to a tranquil little lake basin, with fewer visitors than many of the neighboring trailheads.<br><br>Start from the undeveloped trailhead at the end of FR 4032. The trail takes off right away, climbing moderately through second-growth forest, offering peek-a-boo views of the ridgeline across the way. Switchbacks begin to lead you more steadily uphill before arriving at the first of many meadows, where the rooty tread gives way, surprisingly, to nicely crushed gravel.<br><br>But the good material doesn&#x2019;t last long. Soon it&#x2019;s back to steep switchbacks over roots and rocks. The water that makes the lakes above so delightful soaks the roots lower down on the trail, so watch your step here-&#x2013;wet roots make for treacherous hiking.<br><br>Shortly after climbing out of the first basin, you&#x2019;ll arrive at another, larger basin, dotted with more lakes. Here the trail becomes a little difficult to follow, but you&#x2019;ll know you&#x2019;re on the right track when you arrive at the base of a talus slope. Cairns mark your way up the talus, switchbacking up before leading you into the forest, the entrance marked by an enormous hemlock to the left of the trail. <br><br>Resume hiking, again on rooty trail, switchbacking steeply up and up, heading for the ridgeline. From this section of trail, the pointed tip of White Chuck Mountain is visible across the valley, and the valley below you is dotted with lakes.<br><br>Pushing up and over the ridgeline, you&apos;ll arrive in the Cutthroat Lake basin, a great place to stop and have a bite to eat among lots of little lakes. It&apos;s 6.8 miles round trip to this lake basin, but it&apos;s possible to extend your trip to 10 miles by heading up Bald Mountain. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: If the bugs decide to have a bite as well but you&apos;re not quite ready to head back to the car, keep heading up towards Bald Mountain, the summit that sits at the head of Cutthroat Lakes Basin. <br><br>The trail continues, climbing 700 feet to a junction with the Bald Mountain trail before making a right turn and heading up again for another half-mile through high meadows, enjoying the views of Mount Rainer before arriving at Bald Mountain&apos;s summit.</p>\n                 ",

You will return to this point near the end of your trip. At 4.5 miles, pass a good campsite with a toilet at Red Creek and then at 6 miles, reach Mackinaw Shelter and the last dependable water before White Pass.<br><br>Switchback steeply upward for another 2.8 miles through open avalanche tracks and meadows to the junction with the Pacific Crest Trail, turning right (east) on the PCT and hiking another  mile to White Pass. Good camps can be found below the pass. Turn right where the sign directs you down to the lower pass area and camps. Please respect the &quot;Camp Elsewhere&quot; signs and do not camp on the ridge above the camp area near the PCT. The Forest Service has spent decades working at restoring the delicate vegetation here, that had been badly impacted from over use.<br><br>If you have the time, use White Pass as a base camp and take a side trip or two. The trail from White Pass along the base of White Mountain and out to the Foam Creek Basin is absolutely beautiful! Expect incredible meadows and flower shows. When the trail seems to disappear, hike up to the top of a small knoll and gaze out to breathtaking views in all directions. Glacier Peak dominates the scene but Mount Baker, Sloan Peak, Pugh, White Chuck and dozens of other peaks are visible. Look down from there into the upper White Chuck basin, a land of snow, rock and ice.<br><br>Another highly recommended side trip from White Pass is to hike  west along the PCT to Red Pass and up to the summit of Portal Peak, just northwest of the pass. It&apos;s a fairly easy scramble on an established track along the ridge to the summit, although you may need to use your hands for balance in a place or two. More incredible views from there! Back down at Red Pass, you can continue hiking north and east on the PCT and down into the Glacier Peak Meadows area. <br><br>Another interesting diversion is to hike to the top of the White Chuck Cinder Cone, visible just to the north of the PCT.<br><br>To continue the loop from White Pass, head south on the PCT over miles and miles of mind-boggling ridges, meadows and flower fields, passing Reflection Pond, Kid Pond, Indian Pass, Kodak Peak, which is worth hiking to the top. One mile after passing the Little Wenatchee Trail junction, find yourself at Dishpan Gap. There is a great campsite here, despite being right on the trail. <br><br>Hang a right at Dishpan Gap and hike west 0.8 miles. Bear right on the Blue Lakes High Route. You can also continue hiking another two miles west on the Bald Eagle Trail towards June Mountain, then turn right onto Trail 652 to Blue Lakes and proceed to Little Blue Lake. This adds about 4 miles to your loop.<br><br>The Blue Lakes High Route ascends a steep, cairn-dotted trail to a high pass with a beautiful view across to Johnson Mountain and down to a sometimes frozen Blue Lake in a rocky basin below. The trail down from this notch to the lake can contain a very steep snow slope in early season. If you think you&apos;ll be uncomfortable on it, stick to the Pilot Ridge Trail  to access Blue Lakes. <br><br>Blue Lake is spectacular, and a wonderful place to camp. There is a good toilet near the campsites. Blue Lake also offers the last reliable source of water before the North Sauk.<br><br>To continue onto the Pilot Ridge Trail, take the trail northeast from the lake outlet that descends to the Pilot Ridge Trail junction. Keep right at the junction, ascending through talus and scree for a bit an then on to the huge meadows that traverse the slopes of Johnson Mountain. The trail turns back to the east, following the west ridge of Johnson Mountain, reaching the Johnson Mountain Trail junction, Trail 652.2. With spectacular meadows, flowers and territorial views from the top, the short 0.5 mile side trip to the summit of Johnson Mountain is a must. The entire south Glacier Peak region lies before you. Check out the old lookout site and the four stone pillars that used to support the lookout. What a perch!<br><br>Back at the junction, continue north and west on the Pilot Ridge Trail 652, crossing huge sloping meadows that seem to go on forever. The trail tread through these meadows has not received a lot of maintenance in past years, but is still fairly easy to follow. Eventually the trail finds its way down to the forest but then heads back up and down, and up,then finally  switchbacks relentlessly down for 2.5 miles to the North Fork Sauk River.<br><br>The trail reaches the valley floor where you&apos;re able to cross the North Fork Sauk River on your choice of several stout logs. Walking through a small campsite on the river, you immediately reach the North Fork Sauk trail junction. Turn left and reach the trailhead in another 1.9 miles of glorious forest walking.</p>\n                 ",

To deliver the lead-silver ore to Everett, a railway was built along the South Fork of the Sauk River. Homesteaders filled the valley and the miners created two tiers of housing at the steep Monte Cristo site, as well as mills to process the ore. By 1893 there were more than 200 mining claims. However, the dreams of riches came to a crashing halt as funding woes, flooding along the rail line and miscalculations about the mining potential caused the production to stall and then cease by 1907. There were a few attempts to make this a resort destination, but they too were abandoned.<br><br>Monte Cristo is a ghost town today. A few relics remain, but not much. When visiting, do respect the remaining structures and property.

Do note that this site may be closed at a future date for clean-up of hazardous materials still remaining from the mining days.<br><br>Start at the Barlow Pass trailhead and hike along the closed road for about 4 miles.

Stop and marvel at a huge and impressive landslide gully and contemplate the forces of nature that created it.<br><br>Push through more brushy terrain before entering an attractive grove of big yellow cedars. Soon afterward, the trail comes to a forbidden basin flanked by steep rocky walls-a stark corridor deprived of the sun&apos;s warming rays for much of the day. Scan the encompassing sheer slopes for Headlee Pass. Surely this passage must be up there somewhere.<br><br>Press on over rocky terrain and through cloisters of mountain hemlock spared from cavalcades of unforgiving avalanches, and toil into the high country so coveted by those who hastily built this trail. After a series of short switchbacks and a bit of scree hopping, the trail makes a sharp bend right, the passage out now revealed. The next 0.25 mile is extremely steep on tread periodically destroyed by heavy snows and tumbling rocks. Use caution to avoid threatening hikers below with dislodged rocks.<br><br>Between breaths, stop to take in newly emerging views of Mount Dickerman across the South Fork Stillaguamish valley and of Glacier Peak in the distance.

There&apos;s not much here to compensate you for your effort, so carry on following good but unmaintained tread. After a slight drop, the way resumes climbing, crossing a large scree slope. Carefully traverse the open rock heap coming to Vesper Creek. Then turn up slope to follow the churning creek a short way until-voila! A stark but gorgeous upper valley is revealed.<br><br>Here beneath the snowfields and shiny granite slopes of Vesper Peak is sparkling Vesper Lake (elev. 4950 ft). Of course the miners weren&apos;t interested in any of this beauty, only in the precious gems and valuable ore that might have been hidden be-neath it. And while the surrounding hills no longer carry the sounds of grunting prospectors, occasionally low murmurs can be heard emanating from the alpine tundra.

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Rough and tumble is the trail, just like the miners that constructed this path. Though not always easy, the ascent to Gothic Basin has tremendous rewards. Early on, hikers meander along side the relentless South Fork of the Sauk. Quickly though this trail will turn to a no-nonsense bee-line to the basin with waterfalls, flowers, and views of the surrounding mountains to keep one distracted. The ultimate rewards come to those who have enough strength to explore the basin after the ascent. <br><br>Gothic Basin will thrill and enthrall those who pay the admission. Day hikers will wish they&#x2019;d brought their tents and bags and the backpackers will ache from shouldering the load. But neither will be disappointed. <br><br>Hiking from Barlow Pass, the first mile passes gently along the Sauk River. The significant washout that prompted a reroute several years ago is no longer an issue, so the trail parallels the mighty river. Hike along the road for about a mile before coming to a section where water runs over the road. You should see two bridges in the distance. Here, a trail veers off to the right, straight into the woods. Keep an eye out for an outhouse when you get onto the trail. This is your last best bet for relief before the hike hits the exposed talus fields that characterize the upper section of the trail.<br><br>After an easy half-mile of forest rambling, Weeden Creek must be crossed. Take a moment to appreciate a scenic waterfall here--the trail begins climbing steadily as soon as you make the crossing. The business of ascending begins in earnest after Weeden Creek, with intermittent views and creek crossings. Several spots along this trail require light scrambling over frequently wet rocks.<br><br>Take your time and enjoy the views, both micro and macro. The peaks of the Monte Cristo area loom off to your left. Some mining remnants remain, and crazy abundances of wildflowers choke the trail well into the end of July. Snow crossings also last until late in the season. As always, caution should be exercised as the trail can be blocked or made difficult to navigate by avalanche run-outs late into the season. <br><br>Gothic Basin itself is a special place which deserves much respect. Melting ponds, gurgling brooks, chirping marmots, and towering rock faces greet you in every direction. The temptation is to wander aimlessly. Instead, remember the Leave No Trace principles and confine your travels to durable surfaces such as rock and snow. If you&#x2019;re looking for Foggy Lake, head to the right following periodic cairns and the most prominent footpath. Allow yourself extra time to find the path and to appreciate the natural beauty surrounding you. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: If you&#x2019;re camping, allow lots of time to find a campsite. This is a popular camping destination and the campsites are not obvious. You&#x2019;ll also want a bear can, as there are not any trees in Gothic Basin suitable for a bear line.</p>\n                 ",

Gibbs Lake is a sanctuary for man and beast. But it almost didn&apos;t turn out this way. Thanks to negotiations by the Jefferson Land Trust, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources ceased logging here and converted the 669-acre haven into a county park.<br><br>Over nine trails crisscross the forested hills surrounding Gibbs Lake. Most appeal more to mountain bikers and equestrians than to hikers, but the 1.75-mile Lakeside Trail combined with Jack&apos;s Track makes for a delightful hike. The trailhead kiosk marks the point where you&apos;ll be returning on this loop. Start your hike on the well-defined trail leaving from the southwest corner of the parking lot.<br><br>Cross the access road after 500 feet. Now in damp forest logged during the Depression years, slowly drop to an alder and big fir flat. At 0.5 mile Gibbs Lake can be made out through the trees, but the trail courses away from it, crossing several creeks to ascend drier ground. After 1 mile the lake comes in view once more. Soon afterward, pass two massive Doug-firs, mysteriously granted a stay of execution while their neighbors ended up planked and boarded.<br><br>More big trees, including a grove of mature cedars, are soon encountered. At 1.5 miles work your way through a small wetland. Notice the Sitka spruce, common along the coastal strip but an anomaly in the dry forests of the Olympic rain shadow. At 1.75 miles the Lakeside Trail crosses Gibbs&apos;s outlet creek, ending at a dirt road. Pick up Jack&apos;s Track across the roadway to the right.<br><br>The trail makes a steep little climb onto a bluff above the lake. Stay left at a trail fork. At the next junction keep right. Soon afterward approach a five-way signed trail intersection. Head right on the trail (not on the old woods road), emerging in a parking lot after 0.1 mile. Your vehicle is in the next lot.

Surrounded by snaking sloughs, this 400-acre island offers a slew of scenic delights, from glistening mudflats to glimpses of snowcapped peaks. And bird-watching opportunities here rank among the best in western Washington.<br><br>Starting by the water treatment plant, hold your breath and walk 0.4 mile down gravel 4th Street SE, coming to the trailhead proper at the old Jackknife Bridge. A paved trail leads right 2 miles to the City of Everett&apos;s Langus Riverfront Park. Continue straight onto the historic bridge. The bridge spanned nearby Ebey Slough from 1914 to 1980. In 1993 it was moved here to Union Slough, providing pedestrian access to Spencer Island. It is one of the last remaining bascule bridges (counterweight drawbridges) in the country.<br><br>Upon stepping foot on the island, come to a junction. The trail left follows a levee north to open-to-hunting (check seasons) Fish and Wildlife land. It terminates in 1 mile at a breach. Directly ahead is a short trail (often flooded in winter and spring), leading to a boardwalk providing excellent wildlife viewing. An old barn once stood here. A favorite subject for visiting photographers, it was toppled by a 2006 windstorm.<br><br>For the Spencer Island Loop, follow the levee trail south. In 0.2 mile come to a junction with the Cross Island Levee Trail, your return. Continue right, soon arriving at a bridge, one of several spanning breaches in the levee. These breaches were intentionally made by land managers to allow much of the island to revert back to a tide-influenced wetland. Scan the reeds, cattails, and sedges for myriad waterfowl and songbirds. Enjoy, too, the view east across the saturated flats to Mount Pilchuck and Three Fingers. Note the profusion of homes marching up the hills toward them. The constant buzz of traffic in the air also reminds you just how close the &quot;civilized world&quot; is to this wildlife refuge.<br><br>Continue hiking on the levee trail toward the southern tip of the island. Alders line the way, with an occasional birch or spruce adding a little arboreal diversity. The way then turns north, following alongside Steamboat Slough. Cross another breach bridge and come to a junction. The trail north dead-ends at an unbridged breach. Head left instead on the Cross Levee Trail, traversing wetlands teeming with life. Watch for hawks, herons, harriers, widgeons, and ruddy and wood ducks. Look, too, for bald eagles, river otters, coyotes, and deer.<br><br>In 0.5 mile the Cross Levee Trail leads back to the main trail. Turn right to return to the Jackknife Bridge.\n                 ",

Here you&apos;re likely to run into only elk and deer. Is the trail rough? Hardly. It&apos;s one of the most enjoyable riverside trails on the peninsula. It&apos;s just that it really doesn&apos;t go anywhere-no peak, no lake. And in today&apos;s goal-oriented society, these types of trails are overlooked. But if it&apos;s miles of solitude you&apos;re seeking, and peace of mind that only wilderness can instill, this is your trail.<br><br>The trail starts from an overlook above the Sol Duc. The North Fork is nowhere to be found. It&apos;s hidden behind a small ridge, the only real climb you&apos;ll be doing on this hike. Start by heading up that obstacle through a forest of hemlock interspersed with a few big Doug-firs. Leave the roar of the Sol Duc behind, soon supplanted by the songs of thrushes and wrens. After a climb of about 350 feet start descending, losing all elevation gained. At 1 mile behold the North Fork Sol Duc in all of its wild glory.<br><br>If the bridge is still out and you decide to ford the river, choose a spot about 1000 feet downstream where the river fans out and the current is moderate. Once on the other side, look forward to miles of riverside roaming. At 1.25 miles cross a careening tributary. Through mossy maple glades, under towering conifers, and along basalt ledges lapped by the river, this trail is a true delight.<br><br>At about 2 miles pass some large Sitka spruce trees that might make you feel like you&apos;re in one of the coastal rain forests. A few grassy openings are traversed along the way, and chances are always good for spotting big game in these clearings. At 3 miles you&apos;ll come to a riverside campsite, perfect for snacking or calling it quits if you prefer a shorter hike.<br><br>If wanderlust persists, carry on. After passing a few big mossy boulders, the trail moves away from the riverbank, climbing above it on a steep slope. The river can now be heard crashing through a canyon, while you traverse a stately forest of Doug-firs. As you hike deeper into the lonely valley, numerous side creeks need to be crossed, and a few may leave your boots a tad bit wet.<br><br>At 6.2 miles the trail drops back down to the river in a dark and cool ravine. You can ford it and continue, but most day hikers will be content turning around here. Recall some of your favorite spots on the hike in, they&apos;ll be your rest stops on the way out.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    A moderately difficult hike to a large subalpine lake frequented by many of its namesake critters or an all-day challenging grunt to perhaps the most beautiful viewpoint in the Olympics. This is the famed High Divide country, a land of sparkling alpine lakes, resplendent alpine meadows, and awe-inspiring alpine views. Usually reserved for backpackers with time to explore, strong and tenacious day hikers can get a small taste.<br><br>Deer Lake: The hike to both Deer Lake and Bogachiel Peak starts off easy enough on a 0.8-mile nearly level sojourn through spectacular old growth to pretty Sol Duc Falls. Then the party&apos;s over and it&apos;s time to work. Cross the Sol Duc, pass the Lovers Lane Trail, and commence to climb. On a steep, sometimes rocky path work your way up the dark ravine housing Canyon Creek. At 1.5 miles, cross high above the tumbling waterway on a wide and sturdy bridge. After another 0.5 mile the grade eases somewhat.<br><br>After another push, cross Canyon Creek once more, this time at the outlet to Deer Lake (elev. 3550 feet). Nestled in a forested and grassy bowl, the lake&apos;s waters reflect a soft green. Surrounded by yellow cedar, mountain hemlock, silver fir, and a thick understory of huckleberries, it&apos;s a pretty and serene spot. Deer often browse along the lakeshore and it&apos;s not uncommon to see them in the shallow lake as well.<br><br>A backcountry ranger station and multiple campsites can also be found at the lake. A rough path circles the lake and reveals a smaller hidden &quot;fawn&quot;lake. Call it a day here or carry on to higher ground.<br><br>Bogachiel Peak: For Bogachiel Peak, continue past the lake, bear left at a junction, and climb to more-open country. Winding through heather fields, subalpine forest, and by a dozen pothole tarns (a.k.a. mosquito incubators), the trail works it way up to the high ridge dividing the Sol Duc and Bogachiel watersheds. Alternating between groves of mountain hemlock and open meadows, the trail continues to climb. Far-reaching views across rainforest valleys all the way to the Pacific can now be had.<br><br>Look for what guidebook writer Robert Wood called the snake pit. It&apos;s a cluster of contorted mountain hemlocks resembling a serpentine lair. The trail soon rounds the ridge crest, working its way around a high isolated basin, headwaters of the Bogachiel River. Mount Olympus peeks its icy head over the next ridge, and Bogachiel Peak-still a ways away-beckons. In September, bugling elk from down below can often be heard. And it&apos;s not rare to run into berry-munching bears, so be aware.<br><br>Drop into a big rocky depression where a trail descends to Seven Lakes Basin, one of the prettiest spots this side of Shangri-la. Next, on steep open slopes, angle around Bogachiel Basin. Snow often persists well into summer here, making it potentially dangerous to proceed. After a series of tight switchbacks, reach the ridge crest (elev. 5100 feet). Bogachiel Peak is reached via a short side trail a short distance left on the High Divide Trail.<br><br>While you clamber to bag the 5474-foot former lookout site, no doubt the incredible views by this time will have bowled you over. They are beyond breathtaking. The alpine jewels of the Seven Lakes Basin shimmer below. The snow-capped Bailey Range marches off into the eastern horizon. The emerald swath of the Hoh rain forest spreads out nearly 1 vertical mile below. And rising above it all, staring you right in the face, is Mount Olympus. Its glaciers and snowfields are blinding on a sunny summer day.<br><br>It doesn&apos;t get any more spectacular than this. It was on Bogachiel Peak in September 1989 when I first fell in love with the Olympics. How could I not?\n                 ",

Through groves of old-growth conifers, over cascading creeks, and hugging the lush banks of the Gray Wolf River, the trail marches up a quiet canyon in the Buckhorn Wilderness. Plenty of good picnic sites, too, can be found along the tumbling, churning river. And there&apos;s always an excellent chance of spotting a big critter along the way.<br><br>A new beginning and an abrupt ending have changed this trail considerably since the 1990s. From the small parking lot, start downhill on new trail, formerly a logging road. A series of slides forced this reroute. The new trail starts away from the river, but its slope-side route provides some nice views of Maynard Mountain and the portal to the Gray Wolf Canyon.<br><br>After 0.5 mile of gentle walking, enter mature forest. The Cat Creek Loop Trail takes off to the left. An alternative route, it drops steeply through an ancient cedar grove, and then follows a portion of the old Gray Wolf Trail to return to the main trail about 0.5 mile farther. It&apos;s worth the walk, increasing the sweat factor only slightly.<br><br>The main trail leaves the old roadbed, entering a cool old-growth forest of fir and hemlock and accelerating its drop to the river. At 1.5 miles enter the Buckhorn Wilderness, the river growing louder. Finally reach the wild waterway and traverse a sun-kissed bottomland that invites naps and snack breaks.<br><br>At 2.5 miles leave the river bottom to climb diagonally up a steep hillside. A few breaks in the trees provide views up to lofty Gray Wolf Ridge and down into the canyon. Dropping back to river level, feel a cool breeze embrace you as the trail heads along the surging waterway. At 3.5 miles, after some of the nicest riverside hiking on this side of the Olympics, the trail once again climbs a steep hillside.<br><br>Enjoy good views of the Gray Wolf crashing through a tight canyon gorge. Make your way back to river bottom, and at 4.2 miles call it quits as the trail ends at a narrow gorge that once housed a high bridge. Noted Olympic guidebook writer and legend Robert Wood once observed, &quot;The bridge was built high enough to preclude its destruction from floods.&quot;This was probably the only time Mr. Wood wasn&apos;t correct-a torrent in the early 1990s washed it away.<br><br>Fording the river here is extremely dangerous. If you want to further explore the Gray Wolf Valley, use the Slab Camp Creek Trail. But that&apos;s for another time. Right now, sit by the lovely waterway, letting its rapids mesmerize and its resident dippers entertain you.</p>\n                 ",

You&#x2019;ll need to hike 3.3 easy miles from the trailhead to get to that spot. See the hiking guide entry for Appleton Pass for directions and complete description of this part of the route.<br><br>This is a well-engineered trail of moderate grade that makes its 2.8-mile switchback free ascent to the shores of green-tinted Boulder Lake. Along the way you will ramble through some great stands of fir and hemlock and take in some panoramic views to the south, including the north slopes of Mount Appleton. In late summer, you just might startle a bear raking in huckleberries in the flats just east of the lake. Be sure to bring enough water for the full distance to the lake. The lone creek that crosses the trail can be reduced to not much more than a damp smear by late summer.<br><br>Boulder Lake trail intersects with the Happy Ridge Trail about 0.1 mile from Boulder Lake (elevation 4,300) which is backed up by steep cliff and tree-studded slopes. Its waters ripple in the breezes and cast wavy green shadows on the sand and smooth rock bottom. The huckleberry and azaleas that ring its shoreline put on great reflection shows in the fall. It also makes a fine place for a refreshing swim.<br><br>There are tent sites, bear wires and a throne-style privy a long stone&#x2019;s throw from the lake.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>The trail to Appleton Pass is only 7.7 miles, but it hikes longer.  The route offers some rewarding diversions along the way, but much of the payoff is in the last 1.5 miles with sweeping views as one ascends the meadows and traverses the switchbacks to Appleton Pass. Plan for an early start to your day in order to enjoy lunch, and perhaps even a restorative nap, at Appleton Pass.<br><br>The trail starts at the end of the Olympic Hot Springs Road. For the next 2.2 miles you&#x2019;ll hike on one of the better road to trail conversions. The asphalt was removed, the once hard packed roadbed was scarified and covered with shredded wood to encourage plant growth and hiker-friendly ramps were dug into and out of the culvert removal gulches.  <br><br>Near the end of the road to trail conversion, the trail descends to cross Crystal Creek.  While on your descent, stop and sniff the air. On a still day you can smell the distinct sulfur odor of nearby Olympic Hot Springs. A new (and rockslide-tested) suspension bridge spans Crystal Creek. Once across the creek and up the hill, you&#x2019;ll reach the flats of a one time parking lot now growing over with alder. Veer right and head up the grade the 0.2 miles to the Boulder Creek campground. Or straight to head to the bridge across Boulder Creek to access the odiferous hot springs.<br><br>The campground is so large that it seems out of place.  A generation ago this was a popular car camping destination. Amenities today include a privy and two sets of bear wires. This makes a good base camp for day hikes to Appleton Pass and Boulder Lake, but there is no water supply in the campgrounds. The most convenient water source is a five-minute walk up the Appleton Pass trail.  Campfires are not allowed at the Boulder Creek Campground.<br><br>Once you step out of the campgrounds, it feels like a proper wilderness trail. The path winds for 0.7 miles through fir, hemlock and cedar and past a few step-over streams on the way to the intersection with the Boulder Lake Trail. From the intersection it is 4.6 miles to Appleton Pass. The foot log that spanned the North Fork of Boulder Creek has washed away, so you will need to either ford it or find some logs to cross on.  Be extra careful when fording. The rocks here roll easily. <br><br>The route from the trailhead to just after fording the North Fork has a fairly moderate grade. That changes quickly here-the trail has turned on the &quot;up&quot;.<br><br>Lower and Upper Boulder Falls have worn deeply into soft rock. You&#x2019;ll hear them before you get to them. They are each worth the short side trips  to see them&#x2013; especially after heavy rains or during snowmelt. Shortly after the upper falls, you will cross the South Fork of Boulder Creek on a footlog bridge.  <br><br>The trail climbs from here through alternating sets of switchbacks and long southward traverses that often run near the creek bank.  At one of the first openings along the creek, take a look at the opposite bank to see a great fanned cone of rock that has poured down and through a cleft in the cliff band. The hills really are alive. <br><br>The trail emerges from forest and into a teaser meadow. While you can clearly see the alpine slopes and ridges, you still have a ways to go. There&#x2019;s more forest and grassy wildflower meadows before you get on the set of switchbacks that end at Appleton Pass.  <br><br>There are several good tents sites at the pass Water is available from Oyster Lake or, earlier in the summer, from even closer snowfields.</p>\n                 ",

While many hikers eagerly anticipate the dam&apos;s removal, a few will be lamenting the lake&apos;s demise.<br><br>&#xA0;The real charm of this trail, however, is the forest it traverses.

    "desc": "\n                    Many individual mountains in Washington are extremely beautiful, but no range of peaks is more spectacular than the long, jagged line of the Stuart Range. Along this route, snowshoers will amble up the wide Teanaway Valley and gaze in awe at the impressive summits. The pretty Wenatchee Mountains, a lower, less spectacular range, provide a picturesque foreground for the more massive Stuarts behind. Because of the wonderful views, not to mention the beautiful forest and river environments of the Teanaway Valley itself, this area gets a lot of winter visitors. Snowshoers will find the road well traveled by skiers and snowmobilers, as well as other snowshoers. The route described here lets snowshoers enjoy the views, while tolerating the crowds, before climbing a side valley that is much quieter and less visited. Indian Creek Road climbs the deep basin of the creek, but the road ends before the valley does. That, and the fact that the Stuart Range isn&apos;t visible from the valley, keeps most snowmobilers out of the basin, and skiers prefer the more scenic valleys farther up the Teanaway. Snowshoers might consider these other routes, too, but since skiers can travel faster on the flat Teanaway Road, they beat the &#x2018;shoers to the viewpoints. So Indian Creek valley is the snowshoers&apos; best bet for a Teanaway trek.<br><br>Start up the North Fork Teanaway Road as it curves northeast alongside the pretty Teanaway River. Stop to enjoy the meadows along the river bottom by stepping off the road now and again and ambling out across the open snow for close-up looks at the river. Or head off into the stands of trees that separate the many meadows, keeping a close eye out for small birds and animals that thrive in these protected woods. <br><br>The valley slowly hooks north, gradually revealing more and more of the snowcapped rocks of the high Stuart Range. The road crosses the river at about 1.5 miles, and at about the 2-mile mark, the road and the valley it climbs in are pointed due north. This is where Mount Stuart bursts onto the horizon. The western end of the staggeringly beautiful Stuart Range is anchored by this mountain--a high, near-vertical wall of rock and ice. In front of the great range lies the lesser but also beautiful Wenatchee Mountains. The peaks along this front are less dramatic--no vertical walls of granite here--but they are high enough, and craggy enough, to provide an outstanding foreground to the towering Stuarts in the background. Together, the two ranges create a perfect picture, so make sure to bring along a camera and plenty of film.<br><br>At 3 miles, just after crossing Indian Creek, find the Indian Creek Road angling off to the right. A gate across the bottom of the road--and the fact that the road dead-ends in a few miles--keeps snowmobilers out. Hike up the little-used road, crossing meadows, clearcuts, and deep forests for up to 4 more miles before turning back. A half mile up the valley, all views of the Stuarts are cut off, but Indian Creek is a pretty little stream, and the snowbound valley is a fun playground. Enjoy this route for its own sake rather than for rewards at its end, because on this route the rewards are found as you go.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Easiest to More Difficult<br>Generally good trails for beginners, with moderate elevation change and minimal avalanche danger.\n                 ",

You can follow the highway south into Mount Rainier National Park as far as you&apos;d like, but you can also drop off the road and stomp through the snow along the rocky shores of the White River for a mile or so. Be sure you and your kids stay well clear of the river itself and be careful around side channels and creeks, since running water can hollow out holes under the snow--you don&apos;t want to crash through and land in an icy bath. <br><br>I recommend strolling south at least a mile to enjoy views across the river to a high wall of cliffs on the far bank. In summer, this is just another damp wall of rock, but come winter, it&apos;s a mosaic of rock and ice as the water oozing out of the rock freezes in long beards of ice. At about a mile, the river forces hikers back onto the road, making this a nice place to turn around--if you have slogged up the river bed, you can relax and return on the road. Or vice versa. If you want to continue, follow the road south another mile or so before turning back.

A necklace of sparkling alpine lakes adorning bold mountain faces spans this mile-high valley. Wildflowers, old growth, alpine tundra, deer, marmots, bear-they&apos;re all here in this outdoor cathedral. Your ticket into this wild kingdom comes at minimal cost-the trail is mostly downhill on a good grade, though you do pay the piper on the way out on a grueling ascent.

Bursting with flowered meadows and fluttering with animal activity, this valley is neglected by those in a hurry to get to Grand Valley.

Descend in the wide U-shaped valley, hopping over rivulets and brushing against clumps of fragrant greenery. Try not to fall into a marmot burrow.<br><br>After passing the Elk Mountain cutoff at 1.1 miles, enter subalpine forest. Undulating between meadow and forest, cross Badger Creek at 2.8 miles (elev. approx. 4000 ft). Then, with Grand Creek at your side, begin the gradual climb to Grand Lake. The forest thins as you ascend and cross brushy avalanche chutes and march over glacial moraine. After gaining 800 feet in just under 2 miles, come to a marshy area that announces that Grand Lake is nearby.<br><br>It&apos;s a pretty big lake in a pretty big bowl. Cascading waters from above echo over the placid lake waters. Grand Lake is appealing, but the next lake is much grander. Proceed on stones steps and tight switchbacks through a flower-studded meadow of swaying golden grasses to a junction. Your return is via the trail right. Head left. After an easy 0.5 mile, emerge on an open ledge above the sparkling waters of Moose Lake (elev. 5075 ft)-like Badger Valley, a misnomer. There are no moose here; the lake was named for Frank Moose, whoever he was.<br><br>With easily one of the most spectacular backdrops of any Olympic alpine lake, Moose is surrounded by black-shale pinnacles garlanded with verdant forest. Roam the lakeshore-the open ledge yields to grassy shoreline. Share the crystal waters with fly-snapping trout.<br><br>When you must relinquish this grand kingdom to the deer and marmots, prepare yourself for the excruciating exodus. The trail back climbs 1400 steep feet in 2.4 miles. Look back over your shoulder while catching your breath. Grand Valley&apos;s aquatic jewels twinkle in the late afternoon sunlight.<br><br>Once you crest Obstruction Ridge, enjoy nearly 2 miles of alpine tundra with sweeping views over the Lillian River valley all the way to Olympus.

Once in the saddle, you can turn left and stomp through the wind-stacked snowdrifts along the ridge to the flank of Mount Angeles. Or, for a more leisurely and more scenic trek, turn right and stroll east along the ridge. Be aware that several sections of ridgeline can be heavily corniced--big overhanging drifts of snow--so you need to stay to the center of those sections to avoid collapsing a cornice and starting an avalanche. <br><br>From this open ridge, you can peer south across the Cox River valley to Hurricane Ridge. The rocky spire of Steeple Rock is due south, and the high summit of Obstruction Point anchors the east end of Hurricane Ridge. Follow the ridge east as far as you care to, then retrace your steps, taking care to descend slowly and carefully.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope.\n                 ",

And when it comes to the finest flower romps within that wild area named for the longtime Washington senator and champion of conservation, Cady Ridge ranks supreme. A multitude of blossoms proliferate along this mile-high ridge. But it&apos;s the lupines that dominate, transforming Cady into a purple mountain majesty. And views! From the inspiring Poet Peaks, to the emerald-cloaked summits along the Cascade crest, to cloud-piercing, snow-catching, ice-harboring, horizon-dominating Glacier Peak!<br><br>Three wonderful trails begin from this spot. Take the one that veers left (west), signed &quot;Cady Creek.&quot; The way quickly drops into a gorge, crossing the Little Wenatchee River on a solid bridge. Enter wilderness, and after 0.5 mile of easy wandering come to a junction. The Cady Creek Trail continues west for 4.7 easy miles to 4300-foot Cady Pass, traversing magnificent old-growth forests en route. Head right instead onto the Cady Ridge Trail, which travels steep forested slopes en route to magnificent meadows.<br><br>Immediately gaining elevation, the trail gets progressively steeper as it marches up Cady Ridge. Pass a small creek in a thick hemlock grove. Depending on the snowmelt above, this may be the last source of reliable water along the trail. After a series of tight switchbacks, the way gets even steeper-and dustier and rockier too. After about 2 monotonous miles of climbing, openings in the forest begin to provide teaser views.<br><br>Thankfully, the grade begins to ease, and after about another mile of slogging the way crests a 5300-foot knoll. Look up! Glacier Peak looms above a meadow of lupine. Now the hike gets fun. Continue down the trail, being aware of marmots that have taken up residence right in the tread. Undulating between forest and meadow, the way carries on, skirting around a knoll and charging up another one.<br><br>From this 5525-foot bump on the ridge, catch your breath and enjoy the amazing view of Glacier Peak hovering over the emerald lawns of Kodak Peak. The trail then steeply drops about 100 feet and turns directly west, traversing an open side slope with spectacular views south to Nason Ridge, Mount Daniel, and the Chiwaukums. The tread here is slumping, so watch your ankles.<br><br>Cresting a 5550-foot shoulder of Cady Ridge, the trail continues for another mile through some of the finest alpine meadows this side of the Colorado Rockies. Aside from the myriad blossoms vying for your attention, hundreds of peaks demand recognition as well. Scan the Cascade crest south to Grizzly, Fortune, Benchmark, and Skykomish. Look east to the lofty Poets and north to the 10,568-foot glacial giant known to the area&apos;s first peoples as Dahkobed, &quot;the white mountain.&quot;<br><br>The trail drops to a small saddle with a sometimes-flowing spring and then makes a short, quick climb before terminating at the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) (elev. 5350 ft), 6.5 miles from where you began. Lounge or linger long!</p>\n                 ",

One of the Poet Peaks, a name bestowed upon the prominent points of the Wenatchee Ridge by none other than A. H. Sylvester, Poe is not the highest, but it&apos;s the easiest to ascend. Still, this former lookout site is no easy climb. The way is steep and exposed to the eastern-slope sun-hot. But the extensive alpine views from Poe will leave you raven for some time!<br><br>This is the direct way to Poe Mountain, the trail that once acted as the supply and communication line to the lookout that sat on its summit from 1933 until 1970. It&apos;s short and steep, gaining nearly 3000 vertical feet in just shy of 3 miles. A gentler route to Poe can be followed from Irving Pass, but even that route requires a lot of elevation gain due to its up and down ridgeline course. They&apos;re both great hikes. Do this one when the sun&apos;s not too intense or in September when the slopes are bursting with ripe blueberries and huckleberries.<br><br>Head north on the Little Wenatchee River Trail and within minutes come to a junction. Turn right on the less obvious tread and immediately start climbing. Forming the boundary of the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness, the way attacks Poe&apos;s steep western face through a dry forest of Doug-fir, silver fir, and western white pine. Views begin to open up after 1.5 miles of relentless climbing.<br><br>Switchbacks grow tighter, but the views keep expanding at every turn. So do the berry patches. At 2.6 miles come to an unmarked junction (elev. 5600 ft). The primitive path right is the Little Wenatchee Ridge Trail that heads to Irving Pass.<br><br>Continue left, swinging north around Poe&apos;s summit block. Tread disappears in a small meadow-pick it up again just to the south. Pass an unmarked junction with the Poet Ridge High Route, and soon after that reach an unmarked junction with a spur that connects to the Little Wenatchee Ridge Trail.<br><br>Turn left, and after a final short push reach Poe&apos;s 6015-foot summit. Now wax poetic as you bask in scenic glory. To the south it&apos;s Nason Ridge, Labyrinth Mountain, and Lichtenberg by Jove! To the west it&apos;s Grizzly, Fortune, Cady, Johnson, and the peaks of Monte Cristo-count them! To the east it&apos;s David and his kingdom of peaks. And to the north a dignified line-up of emerald poets: Longfellow, Whittier, and Bryant stand against the glistening backdrop of snowy white Glacier Peak.</p>\n                 ",

But there&apos;s more; finish at a quiet Puget Sound beach with sweeping views of Whidbey Island and the Olympic Mountains. Lunds Gulch forms a green swath in heavily suburbanized south Snohomish County. Protected within the 105-acre Meadowdale County Park, Lunds Gulch is not only a refuge to area wildlife, but also to area residents.<br><br>The hike through Lunds Gulch begins in a small opening on a forested bluff. The wide and well-built trail immediately enters a mature forest of Douglas-fir and wastes no time dropping 400 feet into the emerald ravine. Big boughs of ferns line the way. So do hefty cedar and hemlock stumps, testaments to the giants that once flourished here before pioneering loggers &quot;discovered&quot; them.<br><br>Not all of the big trees were harvested, though. A few giant firs and cotton-woods still stand tall within the lush gulch. John Lund first homesteaded this rugged tract of paradise back in 1878, and it&apos;s nicely reverting back to its wilder days. The trail follows the small creek also named after Lund. Bubbling and babbling, it makes its short journey to the Sound. Come each fall, a handful of salmon make their way up the creek to spawn.<br><br>In 1 mile the trail comes to a junction. The path left leads to the ranger&apos;s residence and to picnic tables scattered about on a manicured lawn. Much of this area once sported a country club complete with an Olympic-sized swim-ming pool and bath houses. In 1968 the county parks department acquired this property and began transforming it into a top-notch natural and recreational gem.<br><br>Continue hiking straight along the creek and through forest, eventually coming to a railroad underpass. Make tracks under the tracks to reach the beach. Rest on a driftwood log, comb the shore, and enjoy a splendid view of Whidbey Island and the Olympic Mountains. Sunsets are supreme here, but don&apos;t forget to allot yourself some daylight for the return to your vehicle.\n                 ",

Both trails at an unmarked fork after this get you to the summit. <br><br>You&#x2019;ll reach the second summit first, then continue to the first, generally more peopled summit. Either high point is an ideal spot to dump your pack and enjoy a leisurely lunch while taking in the panoramic views of Olympics, Hood Canal, Cascades, Strait of Juan de Fuca, Port Townsend, Seattle, and more. After chowing down and taking your photos, head south, the way most people came from, toward Quilcene. <br><br>You&#x2019;ll soon reach a junction, but the sign is tricky to see.

After you set up camp, there are plenty of exploring options, including a second lake over the ridge across the creek. <br><br>After enjoying the campsite, head back to civilization via the same trail you used to get here.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Need those last minute items before you head off, or craving Cheetos and a cold pop when you&#x2019;re done?

After about a gentle mile of this trail you&#x2019;ll come to the intersection with the Royal Basin trail just a few steps before the footlog bridge spanning Royal Creek. Turn right to join the Royal Basin Trail.<br><br>The trail soon makes a couple switchbacks and though it rises above the creek, the clatter and din of the plunging waters provide mood music for your trek.  You&#x2019;ll stay left at the intersection with the Mount Maynard way trail and soon enter Olympic National Park. The trail passes through moss-carpeted halls of firs and hemlocks with a few step-over creeks to negotiate.  <br><br>Soon the trail breaks into talus-strewn open stretches with commanding views up, down and across the valley. The first of these often features a white-ribboned waterfall streaming down a cliff face about a half mile upslope from the trail. After revisiting the creek near some campsites the trail diverges from the waters and climbs via switchbacks again on open slopes.  <br><br>The trail takes on a pattern of long traverses punctuated by steep climbs.  Switchbacks help you on the ascents before Royal Lake. The two climbs above the lake to get to the Upper Basin are more direct.<br><br>At 7.2 miles and 5,100 feet of elevation, Royal Lake is a gem. The land around has suffered in the past from overuse that prompted the Park&#x2019;s camping reservation system. Up valley from the lake is a seasonal Ranger post. Follow the side trail past the Ranger tent platform to a fine view of waterfalls.   <br><br>Shelter Rock with its massive sheltering overhang is hard to miss on your left as you continue upward. With the rock looming almost directly above you, you&#x2019;ll cross a short footlog and start striding upward to where the trail levels off at Arrowhead Meadow. Enjoy the views and the gentle grade. You&#x2019;ll soon be crossing an unbridged stream and ascending to Upper Royal Basin. The blue tarns are to the west and a little bit higher at about 5700 feet.<br><br>Some off-trail hikers can head even farther from the upper basin, either south over a ridge into Deception Basin or east over a ridge into Milk Creek Basin.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Most of this trip is in Olympic National Park. If you plan on overnight camping, the area around Royal Lake and Basin has limited camping permits.

From Marmot Pass one can continue to either the Upper Big Quilcene or Tubal Cain Trail.<br><br>The hike starts out easy and stays easy for the 3.4 miles to Camp Handy. About a mile up the trail you&#x2019;ll enter the Buckhorn Wilderness when you step off the footlog bridge over Royal Creek. Here, the river often runs close to the trail.  You&#x2019;ll spy a milky grey tint to its waters in still pools. This color comes from suspended glacial flour contributed by the meltwater sources of the Upper Dungeness tributaries. At about 2.6 miles you&#x2019;ll cross the Dungeness on a stout bridge.<br><br>Camp Handy comes into sight along the rivers edge at 3.4 miles. Its expansive riverfront meadow and cedar shingle shelter make it a popular campsite for people, which in turn has made it a popular cafeteria for gray jays and chipmunks. Take the side trip down to the meadow and enjoy the views up the valley toward Constance Pass and Inner Constance. This is where some people may elect to turn around, which gives you a 6.4 mile roundtrip hike with 600 feet of gain. But there are more views to be had further on. <br><br>From Camp Handy, the trail climbs without switchbacking in the three miles to Boulder Shelter.

The creek at Boulder Shelter offers the most reliable water on the trail.<br><br>Next stop is the end of the trail--Marmot Pass, 8.1 miles from the trailhead. But you&#x2019;ll probably be stopping along the switchbacks above Boulder Shelter either for a rest or to take in the broad views. As the trees peter out, take a look around and enjoy the clumps of contorted white bark pine.

Cross Silver Creek on a footlog, then begin a gentle ascent on a well-sloped trail lined with rhododendrons.

From Zion&apos;s summit follow a ridgeline trail to a series of ledges, a promised land of sweeping views of lofty Mount Townsend and the towering and jagged Gray Wolf Ridge. Make a pilgrimage in June and be rewarded with a kingdom of brilliantly blooming rhodo-dendrons.<br><br>On a well-built and well-maintained trail, begin in a mature forest of fir and hemlock. The way is pretty straightforward. The trail angles up the mountain, steeply at times, but never at an insane angle. The way is dry, lined with salal and under a tunnel of rhododendrons. Mount Zion ranks as one of the supreme rhody hikes in the Olympics.<br><br>Big blackened snags stand as reminders to the large-scale fires that swept over this corner of the Olympic National Forest many decades ago. After marching up a ridge, the trail sweeps west and then makes a wide sweep back to the east, steadily gaining elevation.

The sur-rounding forest has slowly been encroaching upon the view, blocking much of what was once a supreme vista. Mount Baker, the San Juan Islands, Puget Sound and the Quim-per Peninsula can still be seen over the tops of tenacious conifers. But for the premiere showing-the promised views-carry on a little farther.<br><br>Locate a trail heading southeast from the summit and follow it. Pass a spring that once provided water for the fire-lookout personnel. Continue on good tread and after 0.5 mile of fairly level hiking emerge on a huge outcropping, your portal to panoramic pleasures. Using caution, climb a little onto the open ledge, and then enjoy the view. Mount Townsend dominates the southern horizon, while the rocky high wall of the Gray Wolf Ridge commands the western sky.

In the fall, the squirrels roughhouse in the trees high above your head. Occasionally they drop gigantic pinecones from high above, and while the resulting crash is startling, it is fun to watch.<br><br>The trail is in excellent shape, and gets right down to business, starting off venturing through a close forest with very little understory, but lots of moss. As you climb, you move swiftly from one steep but well-designed switchback to another, and yet another, gaining a little under 3,000 feet in a little under 3 miles. <br><br>While this can be draining, rewards await you at the top. Huckleberry bushes line the trail, and tired hikers can stop and munch on the sweet treats their their heart&apos;s content. After three miles, the trail reaches a ridgeline with a set of switchbacks heading up a rocky face. If you look to the east, some stellar views of the mountains can be seen, and on a clear day Glacier Peak graces hikers with an up-close and personal view.<br><br>Once you&apos;ve conquered the ridgeline, most of your climbing is over. The trail continues much more gently through sub-alpine flower meadows that glow with lupine when in season. Eventually, the trail drops to pretty but stagnant Virgin Lake. There is no inlet or outlet, so the water is entirely snowmelt and rainwater, and by late fall the water is more like a bog. Often, this is a breeding ground for frogs and salamanders, so keep your eyes peeled for plenty of amphibian friends.<br><br>WTA trail crews have had backcountry response teams (BCRTs) working to improve this section of trail for three summers, but use caution in wet weather as small sections can still be muddy, rocky, rooty, and steep, dropping 600 feet in 0.6 miles. <br><br>If you can tear your eyes away from the trail, the view will take your breath away. Across the valley is the foot of Columbia Peak, and ss you round the last point, beautiful Blanca Lake opens up in all her glory. The lake is framed to the north by the peaks of Monte Cristo, Columbia, and Keyes. More than a few hikers have been known to gasp aloud when they round the corner and see the robin-egg blue waters. <br><br>Above the lake, the Columbia Glacier drains via a twin waterfall into the vibrantly blue colored water. It&apos;s the glacial till in the water that lends the lake its otherworldly color. At at the end of the trail lies a small beach full of driftwood, perfect for relaxing and enjoying the beauty that surrounds you. <br><br>Here pikas and marmots abound, watching like sentinels from large boulders fallen from the peaks high above.</p>\n                 ",

At about 5.5 miles and 5,375 feet, the trail crosses into Henry M.

Make sure you bring along an excellent map and heed all instructions about where to cross and when.<br><br>It&apos;s about a mile and a half through forest from the trailhead down to Third Beach. After crossing the beach, you will reach your first ladder to take you above Taylor Point. Watch your footing - it is slippery all along here when wet! And time your arrival back down at the beach for low tide. Scotts Bluff Camp is a great place to camp or push further to Strawberry Point.<br><br>Toleak Point beckons, along with some nice sea stacks. One of many photo opportunities along the way and also an excellent place to camp. Past Toleak there are some natural arches. At the second one, look for the ladder up the headland. At the top you will cross Goodman Creek, which runs high in spring. Back down on the beach is a lonely stretch of sand - you&apos;ll likely have it to yourself. <br><br>Finally, the last stretch requires waiting for low tide or heading up high to avoid the crashing waves - avoid round Hoh Head in any condition. As you approach the Hoh River, follow the Oil City Trail back to your car.</p>\n                 ",

And while they&apos;re in close proximity to each other, you can&apos;t hike from one to the next because those headlands block the way. With roadside access, First Beach is the easiest to get to and so can be crowded. Third Beach requires a 1.2-mile slog down a forested trail. But Second Beach is just right: a hike just long enough to discourage crowds, yet short enough to encourage all who want to see this beautiful beach.<br><br>Well-constructed and well-maintained, the trail starts on the Quileute Indian Reservation.

At the height of the land enter Olympic National Park, and then begin a short, steep descent to the beach, the distant surf growing louder with each step you take.

Circumnavigate the park&apos;s namesake peak by following Trail 130 &quot;round-the-mountain&quot; for nearly 12 miles of forested trail punctuated by the occasional open meadow, or opt to turn around at any time for a shorter stroll.<br><br>Begin the adventure at the large parking lot to the right of where Mount Spokane Park Drive meets the Summit Road. Cross the main road and take Trail 130a as it runs more or less parallel to the summit road. Pass the park&#x2019;s maintenance facility and climb to an intersection with B-29 Trail in the Alpine Ski area; Trail 130 joins the cat track for a short segment before veering left and climbing to Bald Knob Campground and picnic shelter. <br><br>Here the trail crosses the summit road, then runs parallel to the road on the downhill side as it contours towards the CCC cabin and Heritage Area. Watch for a trail marker leading down to where Trail 130 joins the Mount Kit Carson Loop Road, but first consider a side hike to visit the historical site.<br><br>The trail continues along the Mount Kit Carson Loop Road for approximately the next mile until it reaches Saddle Junction. Here it joins Trail 160 towards Mount Kit Carson for approximately one-quarter mile before veering right and entering deeper woods. In another half-mile, bear right at the saddle between Mount Kit Carson and Day Mountain and continue towards the summit of Day Mountain. <br><br>Linger for a moment to absorb the views from the top, then drop sharply down Day Mountain&#x2019;s flank. At the bottom, Trail 130 crosses the Mount Kit Carson Loop Road one last time before descending an old roadbed section that is commonly referred to as the Chair 4 Road. Indeed, after several miles of gentle descent, the trail passes the bottom of chair 4 in the alpine ski area before beginning to climb somewhat and loop around to the ski area&#x2019;s base. Reenter the alpine ski system beneath chairs 3 and 5, then take the uphill cat track that leads to lodge 1. Cross beneath chair 1 and climb gradually to rejoin the B-29 cat track portion of trail 130.  Take Trail 130b to return to the parking lot. <br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: From the intersection with the Upper Mount Kit Carson Loop Road, and along the length of the &quot;Chair 4 Road&quot; portion of Trail 130, the route is open to shared use with snowmobiles in the winter. Also watch for backcountry alpine skiers and snowboarders on the &quot;Chair 4 Road&quot; as they use the route as a cat track back to the alpine ski area after accessing the backside terrain.</p>\n                 ",

The first three miles of the trail is easy, but the last half-mile to the summit is steep and occasionally brushy. Taking a break on that climb is no hardship though: the hillside is carpeted in berries and the views start early.<br><br>Start at the Smithbrook trailhead, an area brushy with neck-high fireweed. Proceed through the brush on a moderate grade and quickly arrive at a more open trail through a nice forest. Pass a rocky area with giant boulders as you ascend up moderately graded switchbacks. At 1.5 miles, arrive at a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail. If you go in September, bring some fresh fruit to share with the thru-hikers bound for Canada -- you&apos;ll see quite a few from here on out.<br><br>Head left (southbound) on the PCT, enjoying a relatively flat section of trail.  The open forest provides periodic views of the rocky wall on the opposite side of the valley. This is a great place to teach young children the joy of hiking. The trail is lined with blueberries and huckleberries&#x2013;the perfect fuel for going just a little further.  <br><br>Approximately three miles from the trailhead, just before dropping to Lake Valhalla, you&#x2019;ll find a turn-off for Mt. McCausland on your right. The trail is unmarked, but an obvious switchback heads up the hillside. You&#x2019;ll quickly arrive in a meadow of low blueberry and huckleberry bushes. The sudden increase in the quantity of berries should give you an idea of the relative popularity of Mount McCausland versus Lake Valhalla and the PCT below you.<br><br>The switchbacks shorten and then disappear entirely as the trail charges straight up the mountain. Bring hiking poles; there are some big steps here and the trail surface is a little loose. Views of Lake Valhalla and Lichtenberg Mountain start right away, and you can still enjoy views from this trail even if you decide that attaining the summit is not part of your hiking agenda. Making it to the summit will grant additional views northeast of layers of mountains and tiny Dow Lake.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Save your energy, if possible, and when you&#x2019;re done with Mount McCausland, head down to Lake Valhalla. It&#x2019;s only half a mile from the junction and there is a nice sandy beach to relax on.</p>\n                 ",

Easy to reach, Lake Janus beckons its fair share of anglers and beginning backpackers, while Grizzly&apos;s bear of a distance culls all but the strongest hikers. Those who do push on, however, will be rewarded with continuous panoramic viewing, all while <br>under the watchful guise of majestic snow- and ice-crowned Glacier Peak.<br><br>Start by following the well-groomed delight-to-hike Smith Brook Trail for 1 mile, coming to a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) at 4700-foot Union Gap. Left, the PCT heads south to Lake Valhalla and Mexico. Head right instead toward Janus, Grizzly, and Canada. Avoiding Union Peak&apos;s steep boulder-bound slopes, the trail descends, losing 700 feet in about a mile.<br><br>Skirt boggy meadows, with glimpses down into the Rapid River valley, then begin climbing again. After traversing a brushy boulder field, cross a small creek beneath a little cascade and emerge onto a forested flat that harbors patches of blueberries. Lake Janus lies just ahead: find a short spur trail leading to the right to its grassy and welcoming shores. Children will enjoy tadpole tallying while you&apos;ll enjoy soaking your tootsies in the warm, shallow waters. Cast a lure into the emerald meadows of Jove Peak that are reflected on the placid lake surface.<br><br>The 3.25-mile hike to Janus is satisfying to most people, but if you came for maximum viewing and aerobic exercise, carry on. Continue north on the PCT, rock-hopping across Janus&apos;s outlet creek. Be sure water bottles are filled here, for beyond, the life-sustaining liquid isn&apos;t always readily available.<br><br>Climbing steadily but gently, the way weaves back and forth in pursuit of the Cascade crest. About 1 mile from the lake, arrive at a heathered swale complete with campsites along a sometimes flowing creek. A 5650-foot open knoll just to the west makes a good viewing and quitting spot. Otherwise carry on, reaching a 5200-foot gap in another 0.5 mile with a mouthwatering preview of the spectacular alpine scenery lying ahead. Bust out of the forest into a granite sculpture garden. Views! Labyrinth, Poet Ridge, and the White Mountains vie for your attention to the east. But the snowy volcanic monolith that is Glacier Peak, Washington&apos;s fourth-loftiest summit, draws and holds your gaze northward.<br><br>In 0.5 mile beyond the gap, an overhanging ledge offers clear viewing straight down to Glasses Lake. A little farther, gaps in the forest reveal little Margaret Lake lying beneath the west side of the crest. After a slight drop, reach a 5000-foot low point where two steep, boot-beaten side paths take off for those lakes.<br><br>Now gently climbing again, the trail hugs the west side of the Cascade crest, revealing nice glimpses of Mounts Hinman and Daniel. Undulating between sun-kissed heather meadows and cool groves of mountain hemlock, the trail continues along the vibrant vertebrae of Washington State.<br><br>Perched in a wide cirque 1200 feet below, Heather Lake comes into view. Against an emerald backdrop with Glacier Peak hovering above, the shimmering backcountry lake looks stunning from high above. Using switchbacks, the trail then climbs steeply up open slopes, providing striking views southward all the way to Rainier.<br><br>Finally, after 8 long but scenically satisfying miles, reach the unassuming 5597-foot summit of Grizzly Peak. A carpet of flowering meadows unrolls northward and entices you to keep going all the way to Glacier Peak. But your tired calves and better judgment lead you instead to lie back in the soft grasses and contemplate the beauty before you. And here in the heart of the Henry M.

But before you make a beeline to the river, a little historical appreciation is in order. Start by admiring the Interrorem Cabin. Built in 1907, this structure is the oldest Forest Service dwelling on the Olympic Peninsula. Interrorem served as a ranger station, a base for Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps workers, and a fire guard station. Currently it&apos;s rented out by the Forest Service for the public to use overnight. Be sure to respect the privacy of any guests who may be staying in the cabin while you&apos;re visiting.<br><br>The first overnighter at Interrorem was Ranger Emery Finch. Mr. Finch, an avid fisherman, was responsible for building the Ranger Hole Trail-a path to his favorite fishing spot, the ranger&apos;s fishing hole. The trail leads 0.8 mile to that revered spot. Through mature second growth (cut circa Finch&apos;s tenure) the good path climbs a little hump then makes a slow descent toward the river. In April hundreds of trilliums line the way. As the Duckabush&apos;s roar becomes more audible, the trail makes a steep drop, emerging at the famed fishing spot.<br><br>While the fishing isn&apos;t what it used to be, you&apos;ll still catch some good views of the river.

The vistas from the road and trail along this route include sweeping views of Mount Rainier, upper Puget Sound, lower Hood Canal, and all of the eastern Olympic peaks. Snowshoers can scatter out and explore untouched snow in meadows and forests well off the trail, or they can stick to the assigned path and make a nice, quiet day hike of it. Or they can do both and spend a night or two and explore the possibilities of the slopes of Mount Townsend. The mountain itself is more of a long ridge. The summit stretches north to south and, although it&apos;s difficult to get to the top thanks to a slew of avalanche chutes, there is no shortage of scenic overlooks on which snowshoers can pause and admire the long mountaintop.<br><br>To find the best snowshoeing options, cross the Little Quilcene River via the FR 27 bridge and snowshoe up the road as it climbs steeply up through broad meadows (clearcuts), traverses around to the south side of the valley, and rolls south to a low saddle at 2 miles (3700 feet). The pretty views of the first leg of the trek are supplemented here with stunning panoramas sweeping from Mount Townsend over the Quilcene River valley, east to Puget Sound, and beyond to Mount Rainier. <br><br>The road drops from the saddle, rolls south around the nose of the ridge and, at 3.5 miles, encounters a small side road on the right. Follow this narrow, brushy road southwest for 1 mile to intercept the Mount Townsend Trail at 4.5 miles. This forested hiking path climbs steeply from its trailhead for 0.25 mile before turning west on a long, climbing traverse to the base of the steep walls of the upper reaches of Mount Townsend.<br><br>Stop your climb before breaking out of the trees near the 4500-foot level if there is even a whisper of a chance of avalanche. If the snow is extremely stable, continue to snowshoe up the trail to reach the ridge crest (5500 feet) at 6 miles. <br><br>When the avalanche danger is moderate or higher, a better alternative for winter camping is to turn left when you encounter the Mount Townsend Trail and descend along it for 0.5 mile to reach, at mile 5 from your car, one of the small, three-sided shelters that were so common in the Olympic Mountains in the middle half of this century.<br><br>Return the way you came or, to complete a loop, hike another 0.5 mile down the trail from the shelter to a trailhead on FR 27. Turn left on the road, and hike 1.5 miles up it as it curves northwest to reach the point where the spur road took off to join the upper trail.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Most Difficult<br>Hikers should have good experience and familiarity with snowshoes. This route features sections that will need to be evaluated for avalanche safety every time. Trails climb considerably and may include climbing to ridge tops. Traverses across forested or open slopes may be required. An ability to self-arrest with an ice axe or trekking pole recommended.\n                 ",

Let&#x2019;s just agree it&apos;s a popular hike and that there are many reasons for it. <br><br>Townsend offers rhododendrons in May and June, wildflowers in June through August, then berries in August and September and fall colors in, well, fall.  Add in old growth, some tucked away waterfalls, and a windswept, alpine turtleback summit with views north across the Strait and San Juans, west and south into and along the Olympics and east across the Sound to the Cascades, and you&apos;ve got the perfect year-round hike. No wonder it is popular.<br><br>The most loved of the routes up Townsend starts at what is commonly referred to as the &#x2018;Upper Trailhead&#x2019;. The &#x2018;Lower Trailhead&#x2019; on this route starts 1.2 miles and 400 feet elevation farther down the valley. It can be a good access option when snow has closed higher elevation roads. The trail starts out accompanied by the crashing of Townsend Creek and soon switchbacks through old-growth with a thick understory of rhododendrons.<br><br>The track makes a long westward-rising traverse through fir and hemlock, interrupted by three ravines. These ravines get progressively more open both up and down their drainages, providing peek-a-boo views across the valley.  Shortly after the trail breaks into a broad, sloped meadow, stop and listen.  You may be able to pick out first the sounds and then sights of a couple small waterfalls. The more obvious one drains off of Townsend and the other off of the Welch Peaks to the southwest.<br><br>Switchbacks resume in this open area and take one from meadow to forest and back to meadow. The open views to the east offer better and better views across to the Cascades. Shortly before Camp Windy the trail crests an open rock face that brings most hikers to a brief halt to enjoy the views and the moment. At 2.6 miles down the trail, overnighters can enjoy Camp Windy as a nice camp spot. The water source, shallow Windy Lake, is a great reflecting pool for the surrounding trees and cliffs.<br><br>The switchbacks above Camp Windy bring you to the intersection with the Silver Lake Trail at 3.0 miles. Swing right to stay on route to Townsend.  Soon you&apos;ll find yourself in open country punctuated by clumps of krummholz skirted subalpine fir.<br><br>Take your pick of any of the outcrops at the south summit of Townsend (4 miles from the trailhead and at 6,260 feet of elevation and enjoy the views in all directions.  Use the rocks for a windbreak during your well-earned rest and snack before heading back.<br><br>Wondering where the other three trails to Townsend are? Silver Lakes Trail approaches from the west, and is reached via the Silver Lakes Way Trail.

There are no visitors centers here either. No interpretive trails or developed campgrounds amid the towering spruce and fir. There&apos;s nothing fancy here at all-just a quiet backcountry trail through pure rainforest wilderness.<br><br>Your first impression of the Bogachiel River Trail may have you wondering, &quot;I thought this was a wilderness trail through old-growth rain forest.&quot;It is-just give it a couple of miles. The trail begins in a dark forest of second growth. It was logged during the 1940s in the name of national defense.<br><br>Descend on a muddy track to Morganroth Creek. During the rainy season (most of the year) expect to get your feet wet crossing it. A small interpretive path leads left to a marshy area. The Forest Service has plans to extend this trail into a small loop. The main trail continues right, intersecting then utilizing an old road bed for some level and easy strolling.<br><br>At 1.5 miles come to the national park boundary. Pooches are not permitted beyond this point. Along rich bottomlands the trail brushes up against the river. At 2.5 miles negotiate a steep bluff (with the help of a rope) to skirt an area claimed by the river. Drop back down to river level and get your feet wet again hopping across Mosquito Creek. Big trees finally appear (I told you it gets better). Despite light use, the trail is in remarkable shape, thanks in large part to the tireless work of the Washington Trails Association. But while only a handful of hikers trek up this valley each year, the elk that pass through are legion. Keep your eyes out for these elegant beasties.<br><br>Ancient giants dwarf you as you continue up the trail. Except for the river&apos;s soothing churn and sweet serenades from resident wrens, the primeval forest is quiet. Lichens drape overhead. Fern boughs burst open from the forest floor. Dew-dripping moss clings to everything. Only the glaucous sheen of alder bark breaks the deep green of the rain forest.<br><br>After 6 miles of peaceful passage, you&apos;ll come to a junction with the Rugged Ridge Trail and a most inviting riverside camping area. This is a good spot to turn around, or if inclined, spend the night. During low water flows, venture out onto the gravel banks of the river.

And unlike many trails, which sacrifice peripheral scenery on the journey for the prospect of a grand summit view, the Woody Trail is consistently gorgeous as you wind your way along the Wallace River and approach the nine dazzling falls. <br> <br>The moderate elevation gain (1300 feet, most of which occurs on a series of switchbacks between the Middle and Upper Falls) might give beginners cause to worry, but you can take comfort in the knowledge that there are still great views to be had at the more accessible Lower and Middle Falls stops. The Middle Falls overlook provides arguably the trail&#x2019;s most impressive scenery with a panoramic view of the Skykomish River valley and the distant portrait of the Olympic Mountains trailing into the horizon.<br><br>Wallace Falls (deriving its name from Kwayaylsh, surname of the first homesteaders in the area) trail is in great condition. Although the park sees a lot of foot traffic due to its popularity, the trail remains well maintained and relatively clean thanks in part to maintenance from WTA, who has had work parties attend to this trail over the last four years. There are some sections, especially pushing on from the Middle Falls to Upper Falls, where the way becomes more rugged, but these sections are brief. <br><br>To begin, find the trailhead just off the parking lot, framed by the information kiosk and the restroom facilities. Trek under a pair of mammoth power lines, which despite doing their level best to ruin potential photo ops of Mount Index and Baring Mountain at the clearing, do not completely remove the grandeur of the view. Continue left, trading the last traces of civilization for the gentle babbling of the Wallace River as you duck under a canopy of aged hemlocks. <br><br>At the half-mile marker, you will encounter a split in the trail. The path on the right, distinguished by a wooden gate (intended to signal that the trail is hiker-only from here on out), leads to the Woody Trail. The left fork diverts to the old Railroad Grade, a longer bike-accessible path. Bikers and more seasoned visitors may swing left to experience the further delights of the park, including paths that lead north to Lake Wallace, but proceed through the gate on the right to the Woody Trail if you are on foot and desire the compact Wallace Falls experience.<br><br>From there, trace the Wallace River where you may catch fly fishermen playing hooky from work or any number of introspective visitors enjoying the many benches and natural nooks that the trail provides. Eventually you will break from the river and encounter the trail&#x2019;s first steep climb. Continue up, encountering diversionary paths for the Amphitheater and the Railroad Grade trail, but stay on the Woody Trail until you reach the Picnic area at the Lower Falls, just two miles from the trailhead. Stop to admire the falls, but push less than half a mile for the prospects of better views at the Middle Falls, which boast the most impressive panoramic sights on the trail. <br><br>There is no shame calling it a day at the Middle Falls overlook, but the hardcore, spry, or those with something to prove will power up the steepest grade of the trail, a sweat inducing half-mile of switchbacks that lead to the Upper Falls, where the path officially concludes at 2.8 miles.<br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: Often known for the nine waterfalls, Wallace Falls State Park and the surrounding parks are less well-known for mountain biking, fishing, swimming, boating, kayaking and rock climbing opportunities. Visitors looking to participate in any of the ancillary activities offered should contact the park and inquire into the seasonal availability of these experiences.<br><br>Dogs are allowed at Wallace Falls, but are required to be leashed at all times. There is a strictly enforced fine for unleashed dogs stemming from a number of incidents where unleashed dogs have been swept over the falls.

Start by wandering along the Wallace River as it tumbles down from the famous falls.  Get your pictures of the falls, then continue your hike by including the large forested Wallace Lake. Return through a green shag carpet of moss, sword ferns and hemlock, following the North Fork Wallace River as it rushes to meet the main Wallace River and your return trail. <br><br>First, be sure that you have a trail map for reference. If necessary, take a picture of the trail map posted on the window of the ranger&#x2019;s booth. Although the intersections are signed, there are many, and it is handy to have something to refer to, if in doubt. <br><br>Start your hike by following an access road under the power lines. Come to an intersection and a marker dedicated to Senator Frank Woody for whom the trail is named. Stay right on the Woody Trail, enter woods and head downhill toward the sound of the Wallace River. There is a short side trail marked Small Falls which leads to, as you may expect, a small falls. It&apos;s well worth the short walk.<br><br>Once back along the river, there are lots of viewpoints and a few benches. In summer, this is a busy place, as lots of families come here to enjoy a picnic by the river. Start climbing above the river. On a nice day, the light rays that come through the spindly trees make for some good pictures. Stay on the Woody trail when you reach an intersection for the railroad cutoff, and then the intersection with the Greg Ball trail. You will be returning from your hike on one of these trails.  <br><br>Reach a high point, head downhill on some well built stairs, and cross the North Fork Wallace River on a good sturdy bridge. Once across, head uphill to the Lower Falls viewpoint and picnic shelter. Soon there will be some great views out across the Snohomish Valley and if you&#x2019;re lucky, all the way over to the Olympics. From the lower falls, you can glimpse the large falls ahead. Keep heading up and in just over two miles from the trailhead, you will be at the middle falls. This is the best view yet of the spectacular upper falls. There is a nice viewpoint with a railing around it that will allow you to get a good look and stay safe. The water here falls is 265 feet, and is visible from Highway 2. <br><br>Once the picture taking is done, head on up to the last viewpoint, in just over a half mile, where you look down from the top of the falls. To continue on to the lake, look for the trail behind the sign. It may be hard to locate. Some of this trail is well defined, but some of it gets lost in roots and rocks. Look for blue diamonds, about six feet up, on some of the trees, and follow these, and consult your map. This trail climbs a short way to meet a DNR forest road. Once you meet the road, turn left and follow the road for 1.7 miles. <br><br>While road walks aren&apos;t known for their aesthetic value, but keep an eye out for pussy willows, salmonberry, coltsfoot and skunk cabbage in the spring, and mushrooms in the fall. These various flora make the wide road more interesting. But don&apos;t get sidetracked by spur roads--your next intersection is signed. Turn right and follow the road a half mile to Wallace Lake. There is a camping area off to the right here, but you&apos;ll proceed straight ahead. Cross the bridge over the outlet stream and have lunch at the picnic table on the other side. <br><br>For better views of the lake, follow the old road along the lake. There are several points where you can climb down and access the lakeshore, but the best views are at the end of the lake. Keep following the trail past the sign for Jay Lake. Cross the inlet stream on some rock filled rubber steps, then hop across more streams. From here, make your way down to the shoreline for some great views of the lake and the surrounding hills. Once done exploring the lake, head back, but instead of crossing the bridge, turn to the right and head down to meet the road. Here you will turn right, and after a few hundred yards on your left, look for a sign for the trailhead via the road. Just past that sign is another one denoting the Greg Ball trail on your left. This is the trail you want. <br><br>This beautifully built trail is named in memory of Greg Ball, the man who launched the WTA trail maintenance program. The path winds gently downhill, through a green carpet of moss and sword ferns, as it follows the North Fork of the Wallace River. You can see some remnants of the forest that once stood here long ago, old stumps with the springboard holes still visible through the covering of moss. There are some spectacular waterfalls here too. Listen for water crashing through a narrow gorge in the rock.  Take a look, but there are no safety barriers as of now, so stay away from the edge. <br><br>There are two ways to finish the loop, both end up back on the Woody trail.  Stay on the Greg Ball Trail after it crosses the road, or walk the road a short way, and take the Railroad Cutoff. The cutoff is a little shorter, dropping 500 feet to the Woody trail. Head out the Woody trail, and finish your hike with a view of Mount Index and Mount Baring through the power lines on your way out. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: To extend your hike, continue on the trail past Wallace Lake to Jay Lake, an easy flat mile further. There is a backcountry campground at Jay Lake, consisting of tent sites, a picnic table and a composting toilet.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>This is a wonderful wild park right here in the backyard of those who live in the Everett area. Covering 1,463 acres of forest, ponds and meadows, the area is named for homesteader Mitchell Lord who farmed the area in the late 1880s. Hikers can roam all day on the network of trails leading through the forest, down to the Snohomish River and up to views of the Cascades and Snohomish valley. Explore, and keep an eye out for the wildlife that live in these woods.<br><br>The many wanderings to be had here start off as you leave the parking lot on the boardwalk trail. Head either left on the Main trail or right on the Beaver Lake trail, either way is good. The Main trail will lead to the junction with the West View trail. Follow that, and it will lead to a nice loop and a viewpoint on Devils Butte, with nice views looking north across the valley to the mountains. The Beaver Lake trail heads down to hit the Pipeline trail, the most direct north-south route. This description will follow the Pipeline, taking you by several ponds, old quarry sites, and eventually to the Snohomish River. <br><br>Once you reach the intersection with the Beaver Lake and Pipeline trails, take the side trail down to Beaver Lake. Here the lake is filling in with grass and becoming more like a marsh. You can continue along a trail around Beaver Lake, but as of this writing, this trail is not on any maps. If you don&#x2019;t feel comfortable just poking around without direction, stay on the Pipeline trail, which meets up with the Temple Pond loop trail. Are you in an exploring mood? Take the route around the east side of the lake, skirting the park boundary above the lake in a wooded area. <br><br>Keep following the trail through the woods, cross a little outlet stream and head up. You will see signs marking this the Red Barn trail, but again, it does not appear on a map. This area was logged at least twice, once of its old-growth trees, then again of the second-growth. You can still see some big stumps with springboard notches, now serving as nurse stumps for red huckleberry. Because the trees here are third-growth forest, enough light comes through for sword fern and salal to thrive. <br><br>Eventually this trail comes to a &apos;T&apos; junction with the Temple Pond loop. Take the left fork and head to Temple Pond, the biggest pond in the park. Reach the shores of Temple Pond after a nice stroll through the forest. The remains of old stumps, clumps of cattails and reflections of the surrounding trees are certainly photo-worthy. Try to capture a picture of a few of the resident ducks. With a little luck, you may see a beaver. Once done, finish the loop and end up back on the Pipeline trail.<br><br>Once back on the Pipeline, follow it downhill, zigzag past a tiny pond where there is an intersection. If you&apos;re looking for a shorter hike, you can loop back to the trailhead here. To lengthen your hike, keep going downhill toward the Snohomish River. Here is another intersection with the Pipeline loop, which makes a loop through the woods here. Go straight down a steep little hill and hit the Quarry trail heading to the west, an unsigned intersection at this writing. This interesting trail takes you past a big grassy bowl that used to be an old quarry, past a large pond, then up and around a ledge above the pond where a nice bench awaits you and your trail snack. Keep following the trail north and it eventually hits the Main trail. The Main trail goes west, then south to the Snohomish River. Eat lunch by the river and watch for eagles above.<br><br>Following the Pipeline trail to the end will bring you to the southern trailhead off of Tester Road. Follow the River View Quarry trail along an old road. Look for some old rusted equipment along this stretch of the trail. The grass is too high for good river views, but you can make your way down to the river bank from the old road. Loop back and hit the Quarry trail, then proceed to wander at will, eventually ending back at the main trailhead. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: You will find it very helpful to download and print the map from the website at: snohomishcountywa.gov</p>\n                 ",

A visitors center and a couple of well-groomed nature trails attract bus loads of admirers from Seattle to Seoul, Boston to Berlin. And its not just camera-toting tourists that invade this valley; pan-toting backpackers and caribiner-clanking climbers flock here too.

Pass by colonnades of spruce and under awnings of moss-cloaked maples. Licorice ferns and club mosses cling to overhanging trees like holiday decorations on New York&apos;s Fifth Avenue. And while the surroundings are lush, the understory is fairly open. Browsing elk keep the shrubs and bushes well trimmed.<br><br>In 1 mile get your first unobstructed view of the river. Gaze out to the High Divide and snow-capped Mount Tom, a peak on the Olympus massif. Pass the Mount Tom Creek Campsite at 2.3 miles; then climb above the river, catching glimpses of deep emerald pools below. Cross Mineral Creek by a lovely cascade. Five minutes later another cascade delights. At 2.9 miles come to a junction with the Mount Tom Trail.

At 5.3 miles arrive at Five Mile Island. Formed by river channels, the island is an inviting grassy bottomland graced with maple glades.

But if your idea of experiencing the Olympic rain forest is sans bucketloads of people, cast your attention to the Hoh&apos;s little known South Fork. Local fly fishermen are familiar with this wild and lonely valley, but most hikers aren&apos;t. Getting to the trailhead can be confusing, but the hike is easy and not very long. The payoff is solitude.<br><br>The trail starts in Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) land that has been intensively logged over the decades. Through scrappy trees choked in mosses, drop down to a flat outwash area. Cross numerous streams in various stages of flow and after 0.5 mile reach the national park boundary. Now we&apos;re talking trees-real old trees, real big trees.<br><br>Pass a monstrous Sitka spruce recently laid to rest by a winter storm. Climb onto a bench, pause and look around in bewilderment. Do you feel small? Gargantuan Doug-firs, western hemlock, and Sitka spruce tower above you like skyscrapers in an ecotopian Manhattan. At 1 mile you&apos;ll come to a crashing creek that may prove tricky to cross after a heavy rain.<br><br>Continuing under a canopy of ancient giants, the trail drops to a lush bottomland known as Big Flat. At 1.3 miles you&apos;ll come to a backcountry campground. A side path diverts right, leading to open gravel banks on the South Fork Hoh. The main trail continues left through grassy swales and alongside colonnades of maples. At 2.25 miles, past more impressive spruce trees, the trail finally greets the river.<br><br>Soon a large washout is encountered, but the trail has been rerouted around it. Cross a lazy side creek on a sturdy log. Ten minutes beyond, about 3 miles from your start, the trail abruptly ends. The South Fork in one of its winter huffs lopped off a huge part of its bank, taking a good piece of trail with it. More tread can be picked up farther upstream, but some difficult bushwhacking is required to get to it. Instead, plop down on the nice grassy bank before you and let the solitude serenade you.\n                 ",

Elk lurk in the grasses here, so hikers keep a weather eye out!<br><br>Continue past Five Mile Island through dense understory to a log bridge where you reenter a beautiful forest full of cedars and mosses. Here, begin climbing until you reach a broad view of the river, nearly nine miles in, and shortly come to the Olympic Ranger Cabin. If you have time, a spur trail near the cabin takes you to a wide gravel bar in the river that offers stellar views up the valley you&apos;re hiking through. <br><br>Move on, exiting the meadow and entering forest before arriving at a fork for the Hoh Lake Trail. Stay on the Hoh River Trail, though the trail will gradually lead away from the water. Never fear though, the trail returns to the riverside at the 12-mile mark, where hikers are greeted with forceful rapids. <br><br>From here the trail begins to climb for the last three miles as you cross a bridge after a mile of hiking. Be sure to stop and snap a photo from the bridge -- the deep gorge plunging away below you and the impressive fork in the river are excellent photo material. <br><br>The trail gets even steeper past the bridge, snaking through more forest before entering a more alpine environment. Soon pass Martin Creek campground, the last place on the forest where hikers may have fires. Continue past Martin Creek and onto your final destination: Elk Lake. <br><br>The lakeside is packed by trees and brushy areas, but campsite trails make it easier to get to the water.

Arrive early to miss the crowds on the way up, but practice good trail etiquette and yield to climbers as you descend.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Round trip to Lake Serene only is 7.2 miles. If you decide to include the detour to Bridal Veil Falls, do so on the way to the lake. Don&apos;t save it for the return as it&apos;s too easy to skip the steep climb when the trailhead is so close.</p>\n                 ",

Emerald Cougar Meadow lies directly below, and Kelly and Klone mountains rise gently behind it. Amazing beauty-and a crying shame the Forest Service allows it to be disturbed by throttles.

Rock roses and paintbrush bob near the trailhead, while avalanche lilys sway in the breeze near the summit. When you aren&apos;t looking at the wildflowers, the vistas are outstanding.<br><br>The trail naturally breaks into a number of sections. The first three-quarters of a mile takes you  through a lowland forest made up of ponderosa pines and big leaf maples. Climb a moderate grade 700 feet to a small waterfall fed from springs that feed Fall Creek. This is an excellent slightly more challenging destination for kids. From the falls, there are excellent views of lake Wenatchee.<br><br>In 2005, there was a fire on Dirty Face that started just west of the trailhead and burned parallel to the trail all the way to the backside of the lookout. As you hike up you can see the various stages of fire ecology at work. The fire hop-scotched up the ridge, burning intensely in spots, while leaving many areas completely untouched. Venturing through these sites is fascinating, and each trip greets hikers with new fallen trees across the trail. Be aware that in windy conditions, these burned-out giants can fall, making it a dangerous environment in high winds. <br><br>After crossing the waterfall, there are a few switchbacks -- a warm up of what&apos;s to come. The trail follows a series of long abandoned logging roads. The trail tracks mostly east, and after few more switchbacks the flat mid section is reached. At this point, roughly 1.75 miles from the trailhead, the trail turns sharply back west along an old logging road.<br><br>Here there is a small sign that points the way. 100 yards behind the sign is the last reliable water. Fill up and water the dog; the hike really kicks into gear in about a half a mile. At 2.25 miles the old logging road changes back to trail for a mile of short unrelenting switchbacks, followed by three-quarters of a mile of longer, (but just as steep) switchbacks. The ground is drier here, so there are fewer wildflowers, though grouse are frequently heard and occasionally spotted. Take time to catch your breath and look around; here the views really open up: east to Fish Lake and south over Nason Ridge, where the Enchantments come in to view. Gaze downwards on kite sailors and windsurfers on Lake Wenatchee.<br><br>The last mile to the summit rolls around to the east of the lookout. In this area, the fire burned quite hot, and for the five years after the fire almost nothing grew in this area. Now the brush, fireweed and saplings are crowding around the remaining grey, weathered skeletons of trees.<br><br>You arrive at the lookout before you know it. The views from here are spectacular. Spy Glacier Peak to the north, and to the northeast look up the Chiwawa valley, where snow hangs onto the peaks well into the season. South across Nason Ridge you can see Mt. Stuart, on clear days you can see Rainier peeking out. To the west you can see all the peaks accessible up the Little Wenatchee and the White River. <br><br>The fire opened up the views from the lookout, but the lack of trees lets more sun in, so don&apos;t forget sunscreen. From July to mid-September, the trail will be hot, so start early and carry plenty of water, but have a jacket for the summit; the lookout can be cool and windy. On your return to the car, you will have more time to take in the views, and don&apos;t forget to reward yourself at the 59er Diner at Coles corner for a milkshake.</p>\n                 ",

Lake Ethel is one of the &#x2018;Scottish Lakes&#x2019;, which includes nearby Lake Donald, Loch Eileen and Lake Julius. The lakes were given names by Albert Hale Sylvester, who was a topographer for USGS working throughout the Washington Cascades around 1900. Lake Ethel was named by him after the wife of Forest Service ranger Frank Lenzie. The other lakes in the area have also been named after female family and friends of Sylvester.<br><br>The entire Scottish Lakes area is great for solitude. Due to its location east of the Stevens Pass, the forest is not as lush, and the Chiwaukum mountains are not as rough as nearby areas, such as the Enchantments. This keeps the crowds away, which results in a great backcountry experience. Another advantage of the area is that some of the Chiwaukum peaks are accessible for normal hikers, who only have to bring enough stamina.

The Gill Creek Road crosses the railroad in a spot where trains are regularly waiting for other trains from the opposite direction to come down from Stevens Pass, so expect that you might have to wait for a bit for the train to depart.<br><br>From the trailhead at 2400 feet, waste no time in ascending through the steep forest with many switchbacks for about 1.2 mile until 3800 feet. In spite of the gain, the way is very well-graded. Now and then, the forest opens up for nice views of the Nason Ridge on the other side of the valley. A couple of switchbacks are close to the Gill Creek, which has a nice volume of water early summer. From this point there is no water source close to the trail until Lake Ethel.<br><br>At 3800 feet, the trail enters a big clear-cut area (this area is private land that is logged). While it is odd to see every single tree eradicated in this area, it does have some benefits. The trail climbs over the next 1.5 mile to 5000 feet and you enjoy expansive views of Mount Mastiff, Nason Ridge and eventually Glacier Peak. Early in summer, the wildflowers are beautiful in this open terrain. This section is also good for seeing wildlife like grouse and deer. While climbing through the clear-cut area you will cross four logging roads. The clear-cut is fairly exposed to wind coming through Stevens Pass, so it can be chilly if windy.<br><br>After re-entering the forest, the trail climbs over 1 mile to 5700 feet, and then descends 200 feet into the valley where Gill Creek and Lake Ethel lie. At the bottom of the descent, join an extremely brushy abandoned trail that starts from one of the logging roads. On the road back, pay close attention and be sure to take the same route back. Shortly after the intersection, you enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, followed by an intersection with the Upper Roaring Creek Trail to the right. Continue straight for about 0.2 mile to Lake Ethel. There are nice camping places available close to the lake, which is surrounded by beautiful steep rocks and waterfalls originating from snowfields higher up, cascading down into the lake.<br><br>Extending your Trip: <br>From Lake Ethel, you can continue your trip on the Upper Roaring Creek trail to Lake Julius. With a high point of 6050 feet, this beautiful trail has a more alpine feel, featuring expansive views of peaks towards the north and east, including Glacier Peak, Clark Mountain, and the Chiwawa Mountains. From Lake Ethel to Lake Julius is 2.7 miles one-way. From Lake Julius you can continue to Loch Eileen, just 0.5 miles one-way, or the bootpath to Lake Donald, which is more steep, another 0.5 miles one-way. Bagging all of these completes the collection of Scottish Lakes. Beyond Lake Donald are the High Meadows, a beautiful high alpine area with extensive wildflowers, beautiful tarns, and snow late into summer.&#xA0;From the High Meadows, experienced hikers can also climb the North Chiwaukum (Point 7132), the more difficult Middle Chiwaukum (Point 7423), and Point 6935 on McCue Ridge. About 2.5 miles from Lake Julius is Scottish Lakes High Camp, a remote retreat where you can rent cabins to enjoy this area for a longer period of time, including winter.</p>\n                 ",

The trail is good and the old-growth forest appealing, but the lake itself is swarming with mosquitoes, shallow and grassy, and with a shoreline trampled by overuse. Merritt appears to lack much merit. A trip in fall, however, when the buzzing buggers are absent and deciduous shrubs streak the lake basin red and yellow, has its charms. And if you want adventure, find Lost Lake, the largest lake on Nason Ridge and one whose tough approach keeps visitation down.<br><br>Like Lower Lena Lake in the Olympics, Merritt attracts throngs of hikers from all walks of life. And like Lena the trail shows scars from the less enlightened. Set a good example by not cutting switchbacks and help educate those tempted to do so.<br><br>In mature timber, head off on a dusty and brushy-at-times but generally good trail. Steadily climbing along a rib, the trail winds through small openings and beneath a canopy made up in part of impressive giant ponderosa pines. Big Doug-firs begin to add to the old-growth mix. As you ascend steeply at times and with aid of switchbacks, Mahar Creek can be heard tumbling in the distance.<br><br>Traverse above cliff and talus and enjoy a window view east out to Alpine Lookout. At 2 miles, shortly after crossing a small creek, reach a junction with the Nason Ridge Trail (elev. 4850 ft). Follow this trail, the more beaten way, to the right on a gentle 0.5-mile journey, passing a small bog and crossing Mahar Creek before reaching Merritt Lake (elev. 5000 ft). Set in a forested cirque beneath craggy ridges, the lake does not have a shoreline with many good spots for lounging.<br><br>To find Lost Lake, continue on the Nason Ridge Trail for another 0.5 mile, climbing 300 feet to an unmarked junction. Follow an unmaintained but very obvious and used trail left, climbing another 250 feet to a forested saddle. Enjoy excellent views of Merritt Lake along the way. Ignore side trails (unless you want to explore view-providing knolls). Continue straight through heather meadows, and then drop steeply 600 feet to Lost Lake (elev. 4930 ft), set in a cirque beneath Mount Mastiff.

    "desc": "\n                    <p>This is one of the most popular hikes along the US 2 corridor, and it&apos;s easy to understand why: a historic and active fire lookout, an enclave for mountain goats, miles of flower-blooming meadows, jaw-slacking views of Lake Wenatchee, Glacier Peak, and hundreds of other peaks. It&apos;s amazing there aren&apos;t more hikers sunning themselves on this Nason Ridge summit. And being on one of the area&apos;s first high peaks to shed its winter snows, Alpine Lookout makes for an excellent early summer adventure. But a few blemishes make this well-esteemed hike less than perfect. The first 1.6 miles are quite steep. The next 3 miles are open to motorcycles. And the entire 5 miles is bone dry for much of the season. Get an early start, pack plenty of water, and avoid busy weekends.<br><br>Start hiking via the Round Mountain Trail, immediately climbing, and steeply. In 0.5 mile enter the edge of a 1990s burn (elev. 4600 ft). The scorched forest is recovering nicely. Silver snags stand surrounded by swaying strands of fireweed. Nuthatches and woodpeckers busily grocery shop up and down their weathered and withered trunks.<br><br>Enjoy views southeast over waves of forested ridges resembling the Blue Ridge Mountains of the American Southeast. The grade eases somewhat as the way reenters green forest after about 0.5 mile. Traverse pocket meadows before reaching the Nason Ridge Trail at 1.6 miles (elev. 5200 ft).<br><br>Turn left, following wheel-beaten tread along the high crest of Nason Ridge. Note that while most motorcyclists stick to the trail, a few renegades have veered off, leaving ugly scars in the fragile forest floor. Frustrating and disheartening. Best to cast your attention to the upcoming series of excellent window views to Glacier Peak and over Lake Wenatchee to set your mood back in positive territory.<br><br>Skirting the 5700-foot summit of Round Mountain, the trail moseys along, breaking out into open meadows (elev. 5500 ft) that provide splendid viewing west along Nason Ridge and south to the Chiwaukums. Undulating between forest and meadow, the trail reaches an elevation of 5600 feet before dipping to a small saddle (elev. 5450 ft).<br><br>Regain elevation lost and then some, following tread that at times is deeply eroded (blame the motorcycles). At 3.7 miles reach another small saddle, and then round a small knoll before emerging on a broad ridge. More meadows! More views! Gently climbing, the trail rounds yet another knoll (elev. 6100 ft) before dropping a couple hundred feet to rocky Ninemile Saddle at 4.5 miles. Overhanging and balancing rocks add intrigue to this rugged spot. Motorcycles are barred from continuing farther, but you aren&apos;t. Carry on, making one last climb.<br><br>Come to a signed junction. The main trail heads left to the high hinterlands of Nason Ridge. Take the spur right, reaching the Alpine Lookout after 0.3 mile. One of only a handful of lookouts still staffed in the Cascades, there&apos;s a good chance a real live lookout may be present.<br><br>But you have some looking out to do too. The views are amazing from this 6237-foot knob: Straight down to Lake Wenatchee and the oxbowing White River flowing into it. South to Big Jim, Snowgrass, Rainier, and Stuart. West to Hinman, Daniel, Jim Hill, Rock, Mastiff, and Howard. North to Sloan, the Poet Ridge, Buck, and Glacier. And east to the Entiat and Chelan ranges and the &quot;rock chimneys&quot; of Chiwawa Ridge. What a panorama! Hang around late in the day or arrive early in the morning, and perhaps you&apos;ll share this alpine splendor with the resident mountain goats.</p>\n                 ",

Sure, it&apos;s a long gravel road to the trailhead. And yes, the trail has some steep ups and downs. But the tread is good and the vertical suffering short-lived. Culminating on a peak named Scorpion, the hike gives a panoramic payoff of jagged peaks and emerald ridges that will leave you momentarily paralyzed.<br><br>Begin by following an old road-turned-trail through an old cut turning back to forest. While it&apos;s a steep start, delectable views of nearby peaks, especially of the serrated summits surrounding Spire Mountain and El Capitan, offer nice diversions. Those impressive peaks across the Beckler River valley, along with the ridge you&apos;re now traipsing on, are all part of Washington&apos;s newest federal wilderness area, the Wild Sky (see &quot;Untrammeled Central Cascades&quot; in this section).<br><br>After 0.75 mile the grade eases and the way becomes real trail. Through mature forest flush with huckleberries, the way gently marches along Johnson Ridge. Climbing, however, resumes-and steeply. At 2 miles round the heather-graced 5050-foot summit of Sunrise Mountain. Enjoy outstanding views east of the meadow-cloaked high country that embraces the Cascade crest, with snowy sentinel Glacier Peak watching over. Cherish, too, the view north of the Monte Cristo peaks, an impressive wall of ice and rock. Sunrise Mountain makes a perfectly fine destination for those seeking a shorter hike.<br><br>But if it&apos;s Scorpion Mountain you wish to strike out for, continue on, steeply dropping more than 300 feet to a narrow saddle. Commence climbing again through patchy meadows and thinning forest. At about 3.5 miles enter a full-blown meadow replete with resplendent wildflowers. Retreating momentarily from the emerald lawns, the trail creeps up the steep ridge crest before traversing flower-studded fields just below Scorpion&apos;s summit.<br><br>At an unmarked junction, head left, making one final hurrah to subdue Scorpion&apos;s 5540-foot rounded summit and reap the spoils of 360-degree Central Cascades <br><br>viewing: East to Poet Ridge, Grizzly, McCausland, and the Chiwaukums. South to Captain Point, Fernow, Daniel, Hinman, and Cathedral Rock. North it&apos;s Evergreen, Sloan, Benchmark and Fortune, while west it&apos;s Baring, Spire, and Troublesome.

Absent are the crowds. Plentiful is the solitude. Visit in early summer to an awakening valley while the surrounding high country still lies dormant. Or come in late fall while much of nature prepares to close for the season. But no matter the season, Whitepine Creek will be busy lulling you with its soothing sonatas.<br><br>On good, wide tread, head into dark forest. Making your way toward Whitepine Creek, cross numerous side creeks also eager to meet it. Pass by big burnt snags and a few remnant giant firs. A few white pines line the way too. Once abundant throughout the Cascades and Northern Rockies, this elegant ever-green has been decimated by a blister rot (a type of fungus) accidentally introduced from Europe a century ago. But maybe someday these beautiful trees will once again dominate Washington hillsides. Forest Service scientists have recently been successful breeding rust-resistant specimens.<br><br>Continue up the valley, breaking out of forest to cross brush- and shrub-choked avalanche chutes. Enjoy close-ups of cliffy Arrowhead Mountain and views downvalley to bulky Nason Ridge. At about 1 mile enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Not far beyond, take a break on a sunny ledge above a small cascade on the creek.<br><br>Head through another brushy avalanche zone and pass by a second wilderness boundary sign (yeah, I&apos;m confused too about why it&apos;s there). At just shy of 2.5 miles come to a junction with the Wildhorse Creek Trail (elev. 3200 ft). Continue a short distance to the right on light tread to a lush bottomland of giant cedars, black cottonwoods, and Engelmann spruce. One particular tree, a triple-trunked monster cedar, is especially impressive. Most day hikers will want to call it quits here. To go farther requires a ford of the Whitepine, a crossing that can be tricky at times. <br><br>User-supplied info to extend the trip to a loop:<br>Water may be low enough by mid to late August to ford Whitepine Creek. From the ford, it is 6 miles to Icicle Creek Tr #1551. This section is getting overgrown but is quite serviceable and completes the Whitepine - Wildhorse - Frosty Pass - Doelle Lakes - Chain Lakes - Icicle Creek loop.<br><br>A principle use of Whitepine Creek #1582 is accessing Wildhorse Creek #1592 at about 3 miles. Here, you&apos;ll start buying your altitude and reach Frosty Pass in under 7 miles of lovely open country. Campsite at the 3rd and 4th stream crossings (depending on what you count as &quot;streams&quot;). Grace Lake is a nice place.<br><br>From Frosty Pass, follow the &quot;Horse Camp&quot; signs which lead to an unmaintained section of Icicle Ridge Tr#1570 to Doelle Lakes and Chain Lakes Tr#1569. This leads to Icicle Creek Tr#1551, and Whitepine Creek Tr#1582 completes this fine loop. Don&apos;t commit to the clockwise loop unless you know the ford conditions.<br><br>0.9 miles before the Whitepine Creek trailhead is a gated logging road that leads high up, almost to the ridge (Alpine Lakes Preservation Society map). Take the left fork. A short, steep bushwhack straight up the ravine leads to the ridge and the Lake Ethel Trail, from whence you can do a long loop via Ladies Pass and Frosty Pass back to the Whitepine Creek trailhead (see trip reports by Cascade Liberation Organization).

Just beyond the old wooden bridge is the western terminus of the Notch Pass Trail. Continue through a series of old rapidly recovering clear-cuts , and then at 4 miles enter the forest primeval once more.

Wild, rugged and stunning, this section passes through two wilderness areas and a National Park, allowing hikers to experience the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest untarnished by civilization. <br><br>Steven&apos;s Pass offers day-hikers and backpackers a good starting point, and through-hikers can stop here for supplies. From here, you&apos;re on your own as the PCT heads deep into the North Cascades. Expect a lot a climbing, and a lot of descending (26,351&apos; of gain, as well as 25,552&apos; of elevation loss) as the trail winds northward up and down the mountains, valleys and canyons of the Glacier Peak Wilderness. Be sure to take plenty of breaks, both to catch your breath and to take in the glorious surroundings, which include views of dozens of peaks, glaciers, mountain lakes and alpine meadows.<br><br>Summer and early fall are the best times to hike this section, as thick snow-pack, treacherous river crossings and high avalanche danger often make it impassable through mid-summer. No matter when you hike it, be sure to check current conditions before heading out so you&apos;re abreast of any bridge outings or hazardous conditions. <br><br>In particular, check on the status of the 50-mile reroute around a heavily flood-damaged 45-mile stretch of Section K. Though the trail is expected to re-open with newly built bridges for the 2011 season, check the Forest Service Website (<a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/wenatchee/conditions/pct/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/wenatchee/conditions/pct/</a>) for up-to-date information about the detour and new route.    <br><br>Water is plentiful on this section, but through hikers and backpackers should be sure to pack everything they need for the journey, as the only available supply stop is through a National Park Service shuttle at the Stehekin River around the 100-mile mark.

The length of the trail and the steepness with which it climbs are secondary considerations, however, for snowshoers will find an inordinate amount of natural beauty and winter wilderness on this trail. The idyllic little lake basin is situated in such a way that snowshoers who pause here for lunch may enjoy unmatched views of the whole of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area--from Mount Daniel to Mount Stuart--as well as the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area to the north, the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness Area to the east, and the beautiful Skykomish Valley to the west.<br><br>From the parking area, climb north along a groomed road leading past a number of small skier cabins on the edge of the forest above the highway. The groomed snow-cat track angles north away from the highway and ends abruptly near a power shack about 0.25 mile up the slope. Dig your snowshoe cleats into the hillside, and continue straight up the hill. Stay near the trees on the west side of the open slope to minimize avalanche danger and collisions with telemark skiers whooshing down the slope. After nearly a mile of climbing, at the 5000-foot level, the slope tapers off a bit and the climbing becomes easier. Pause here to catch your breath and soak in the views. <br><br>Turn and look south. At what seems just an arm&apos;s length away, the Stevens Pass Ski Area sprawls out across the slopes on the opposite side of the highway. Above and beyond those groomed runs (long, white scars on the dark green forest) stand the summits of the Alpine Lakes peaks. Mount Stuart, like a massive granite wall, looms in the southeast. Mounts Daniel and Hinman, the glaciated peaks in the center of the wilderness, rise like twin towers to the southwest. Nearer in, Thunder Mountain rises on the Cascade Crest just south of the ski area, and Bulls Tooth sits on the southern horizon.<br><br>After a well-deserved rest, continue climbing the now moderate slope, and in just 0.5 mile, trudge through a young stand of fir to come upon the shores of Skyline Lake. At 5100 feet, this lake is generally high enough that the ice cap on it freezes solid enough to support skiers and snowshoers; indeed, the broad flat surface of the lake is almost always crisscrossed with ski and snowshoe tracks. Unless you have a desperate need to cross a frozen lake, however, it&apos;s always a good idea to skirt the lake&apos;s shore rather than risk the ice. The combination of generally mild winters and the volcanic nature of the Cascade Range makes all lake ice suspect. Even if temperatures are cold enough long enough to freeze a lake solid, the geothermal activity below the mountains creates a lot of warm and hot springs, some of which can spout out of the ground in the middle of a lake, keeping it warmer than you might expect. In effect, these unseen warm springs sometimes melt the surface ice from underneath.<br><br>A long, relaxed lunch along the shores of the lake allows ample time to marvel at views to the south as well as the now-revealed vistas to the north, which include views of Glacier Peak and Lichtenberg Mountain. To extend the outing, amble west along the crest of Skyline Ridge for up to 2 more miles before returning to your car.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful.

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Lake Valhalla is a gem, tucked under Lichtenberg Mountain and Mount McCausland on the PCT North of Stevens Pass. The lake is a great day hike in summer or fall and accessible by snowshoe in the winter. Wildflowers abound in early summer, berries in late summer and fall colors make vivid surroundings in autumn. Valhalla is a popular destination in winter as well, though the access point and the route are very different; see our Hiking Guide entry for Lake Valhalla Snowshoe for further details on this route. <br><br>In summer, there are two ways to access Lake Valhalla, either via the Smithbrook Trail #1590, or from Stevens Pass using a section of the PCT. Both routes offer similar elevation gain; the Smithbrook route starts at 3800 feet, just 200 feet lower than the Stevens Pass route. However, the Stevens Pass route is longer, while the Smithbrook route is more kid-friendly. <br><br>Approaching Lake Valhalla from the Smithbrook trail, the grade is modest, and while there is plenty to look at, the round-trip distance is moderate. The trailhead has an ample parking area off Forest Service Road 67. A recent reworking of the trail starts off with gentle switchbacks. After you cross the wilderness boundary, keep your eyes peeled for the 8-foot diameter Douglas fir that fell across the trail a few years ago. This tree was too big to cut with a crosscut saw so it was cleared using blasting. While chainsaws are not permitted in the wildness area, chemical reactions are. <br> <br>The trail continues up to Union Gap where it meets the PCT. In August and September, you will frequently meet PCT thru-hikers as they head north to Stehekin and the end of their journey at the Canadian Border. They are generally friendly and happy to share their stories for a few minutes, particularly if you have some fresh fruit or cookies to share. <br><br>After conversing with thru-hikers, turn south at Union Gap and climb gently to the gap between Mounts Lichtenberg and McCausland where you get your first glimpse of Lake Valhalla, shining in the cirque below. Just before reaching the gap, a boot trail follows the ridge up to an old lookout site at Mount McCausland. Less then a half a mile and 600 feet of climbing are rewarded with a great view of Glacier Peak to the north. There are lots of huckleberries in the meadows along this trail.<br><br>Pass over the gap and descend to Lake Valhalla. There are a number of overnight campsites and a couple of backcountry toilets at the lake, though please note that no campfires are permitted. There is a very pleasant sandy beach, perfect for lunch. Small 4-or 5-inch cutthroat jump along the shore trying to catch the bugs skimming the lake surface.<br><br>If you&apos;re looking for a longer hike, start from the Stevens Pass parking lot on the north side of the highway, behind the power station that feeds the Ski Area. The first mile of the trail is along an old rail bed, used before tunnels were dug to route the railway under Stevens Pass.  If you look carefully, you can see where the railroad switchbacked up from Yodelin. Watch the downhill side and you will see the clearly graded roadbed ascending, although it has lots of trees growing on it now. The trail continues along the rail bed for another 500 yards or so, where the train was backed in to clear the switchback, before proceeding up and over the pass. <br> <br>As the rail bed section of the trail ends, head away from the noise of Highway 2 and into a series of meadows. This is a beautiful section of trail, providing a good example of what hikers will find if they continue north on the PCT. A modest grade with well-maintained tread, wildflowers, huckleberries, and good views awaits you here. Mount Lichtenberg looms large above as you climb up to the basin where Lake Valhalla is tucked. This route is 10 miles roundtrip and offers 1000 feet of elevation gain.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Thru-hike the trails to Lake Valhalla using a key swap! Using two groups of hikers, have one group start at Smithbrook and the other at Stevens Pass. Meet in the middle for a picnic at the lake, then swap car keys, and continue on to the trailhead that the other group departed from. This makes for a 9.9-mile long dayhike for both groups through a wide variety of terrain and views.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>According to Norse mythology, Valhalla is the beautiful home of heroes slain in battle. Fortunately for snowshoers, this Valhalla is no myth, and visiting it doesn&apos;t require mortal combat. Lake Valhalla is a wondrous basin nestled alongside the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) just north of Stevens Pass. Tucked between Mount McCausland and Lichtenberg Mountain, the lake appears remote and isolated. The snowshoe hike to the lake belies that wildness, though, because the trail is generally easy enough for novices and family groups. Although summer hikers can access Lake Valhalla by way of the PCT, snowshoers will find it easier, and safer, to make use of the narrow road leading up Smith Brook valley to the east, and then to traverse cross-country through the head of that valley to the lake basin. This path provides good footing, safety from avalanche danger, and stunning views along its route.<br><br>With snowshoes in hand, follow the shoulder of the highway west to the start of Forest Road 6700 (Smith Brook Road). The plows will have left a high, vertical wall of snow between the road surface and the top of the untracked snow, so a climb is generally required. In heavy snow years, this embankment has been known to be as much as 18 feet high, but generally it is less than 10 feet. An ice ax can be handy here, not only for added traction in climbing but to chop out steps. If you don&apos;t want to chop your own, bear in mind that by midmorning Saturday on most winter weekends someone will have dug a rough staircase into the bank.<br><br>The trail follows the narrow Smith Brook Road through a thin stand of forest along a near-level bench for the first 0.25 mile before beginning a gentle climb up the creek valley. The lower section of the valley has been logged, so the second-growth forest is dotted with clearcut sections for the first 1.5 miles of the hike. Look for birds and small animals where the forests and meadows meet: generally, camp-robber jays (a.k.a. whiskey jacks) flit through the area, and snowshoe hares leave tracks by the edges of the meadows.<br><br>At nearly 2 miles, the road switches back twice to gain elevation above the creek bed. Here, in the midst of a sloping clearcut meadow, some nice views open up west toward Mount McCausland and north to Union and Jove Peaks. The route then follows the creek as it banks toward the west. <br><br>Just over 2.5 miles up, at 4000 feet, the road again loops through a switchback turn. This is the end of the road, but not the trail. Leave the road at the apex of that switchback, and traverse the open hillside above Smith Brook. Climb slightly while snowshoeing across the valley wall to get near the 4600-foot level in the next mile. There, at 3.5 miles from the trailhead, catch the snow-obscured PCT, cross the head of the Smith Brook valley, and hike another 0.25 mile southwest to the Lake Valhalla basin at 4800 feet. Enjoy a rest at the lake while soaking in the views of Lichtenberg Mountain, Nason Ridge, Union and Jove Peaks, Mount McCausland, Valhalla Mountain, and Skyline Ridge.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope.</p>\n                 ",

One story holds that Harvey Manning -- angry that logging in the lower Eagle Creek basin made road access to Eagle Lake via the Fisherman&apos;s route too easy -- intentionally omitted directions to this trailhead in his guidebook. <br><br>The roadside parking area is marked with a &#x201C;National Forest Wilderness&#x201D; sign that bears a map of the region. The sign erroneously indicates &#x201C;Barclay Lake #1055,&#x201D; but knowledgeable hikers have indicated the location of the trailhead and the trail route with black marker. If you see this wrong sign, then you are in the right place! <br><br>Head northwest into the brush that lines trail, which starts over rocky tread. Pass through the alder-dominated brush into second-growth forest and finally into old growth forest, populated by western red cedar, subalpine fir, western hemlock, and mountain hemlock. The trail starts off rocky but then becomes rooty as it enters the Wild Sky Wilderness. The high rainfall in the wilderness helps sustain moss, maidenhair ferns, and deer ferns. To your right, peek through the trees for glimpses of Townsend Mountain, towering over you. Munch on huckleberries if you hike during the late summer or fall.<br><br>Over 1.9 miles the rugged trail gains 600 feet to a maximum height of 4000 feet, then descends slightly and comes to a circular clearing. The trail to the left heads to Stone Lake and ultimately down to Barclay Lake, while the trail to the right leads into Paradise Meadow and continues northwest for 0.6 miles through a wetland crisscrossed by creek channels and dominated by heather and huckleberry bushes. Stick to the best-defined bootpaths to minimize your environmental footprint. You may have to jump over a few creeks along the way. Boots, a map, and a compass are a must to ensure that you reach your destination with dry feet.<br><br>As you approach Eagle Lake, Merchant Peak looms overhead to your west. Townsend Mountain is to the northeast. Watch for chipmunks, coastal tailed frogs, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and trout that live in and around the lake and Paradise Meadow. Lakeside flora include mountain ash, mountain hemlocks, and paintbrush. <br><br>Follow the paths to explore the cabin on the southeast shore of the lake, which is stocked with food and heating supplies.

It&apos;s a quiet, little known and infrequently visited spot, less than an hour&apos;s drive from Seattle.<br><br>From the parking area, walk pass the gate and follow the logging road down into the valley of Stossel Creek. The road appears to be well used, although I didn&apos;t see any activity on the Saturday when I walked it. Be prepared for log trucks if you visit during the week. The Stossel Creek valley is forested and peaceful, the only sound accompanying you is the soft rush of the creek below. Birds love the wetlands along the floor of the valley. In a half mile the road crosses the creek and after a short distance begins a steep climb out of the valley. <br><br>Just before the climb, note a path branching right and heading south along the valley floor. This path is an old road, well worth following as it soon reaches the placid waters of Swan&apos;s Mill Pond, and follows the east shore. The path eventually reaches a lovely flat area on the shore of the pond, next to a jumble of mossy boulders. On a clear day, the lake reflects the low winter sun onto this spot, creating a pleasant oasis of warmth. The perfect spot for a picnic! From here,the path continues heading south to the old dam that forms the lake, then crosses the creek. At high water, this crossing can be tricky: you have a choice of wading the creek or scrambling across a jumble of wet, slimy logs. If you do make it across, the path reaches the Tolt Pipeline Trail after one-third of a mile.<br><br>Instead of crossing the creek, you may choose to return to the first road, following it out of Stossel Creek valley. This road gradually climbs up a quiet side-valley, passing through logged forest in various states of regrowth. Some recently logged areas are visible, but these are generally tasteful, selective cuts that aren&apos;t too ugly. About a mile from Stossel Creek, the road reaches a high point and a junction. Leave the main road here, and follow a gated, little-traveled road southward. This road&apos;s mossy surface is pleasant to walk on. It meets up with a junction of Tolt Pipeline Trail in a mile. Along the way, you get glimpses of snowy Cascade peaks. Just before the Tolt Pipeline junction, another overgrown-looking road branches right. If you are adventurous, you might try hiking this road instead of slogging along the Tolt Pipeline Trail.<br><br>Beyond The Tolt Pipeline is the start of yet another road, next to a chain link fence. This road may take you to the Old Swimming Hole on the Tolt River.<br><br>The Tolt Pipeline Trail extends for miles, and comprises a grassy strip and narrow paved road occupying a wide swath in the forest. A wood fence separates the grass from the road. Hikers are supposed to walk on the grass and stay off the road, but the grass is frequently lumpy and muddy, so you will be tempted to walk on the road anyway. Traffic on the road is almost nil on weekends (only service vehicles with permits can use it), so there seems to be little risk in doing so.<br><br>If you head east on the Tolt trail, in a mile you will reach a bridge over the Tolt River. Beyond the bridge, the pipeline corridor is not open to the public. Heading west, the Tolt Pipeline trail will take you back in a mile to Stossel Creek, the path dropping steeply as the valley is approached. A large marsh occupies the floor of the Stossel Creek valley, another great bird watching area. Just beyond the marsh, look for the a trail on the north side, marked by a trampled path heading up a bank, a blue ribbon, and some boulders. This will take you back to Swan&apos;s Mill Pond and your car.<br><br>Another trail branches off, which provides more hiking possibilities. One branch of this road passes Beaver Lodge Lake before rejoining the Tolt Pipeline about one mile west of this point. Give it a try!</p>\n                 ",

Follow this road-turned-trail and the corresponding junctions as follows. At three-quarters of a mile you&#x2019;ll cross Margaret Creek on a bridge. Shortly after that, stay left at the first junction and right at the second, ignoring any grassy overgrown roads.<br><br>After climbing a short hill, stay right at the third junction and proceed downhill. At 1.5 miles, the road makes a sharp hairpin to the right. Head left on a muddy track through the woods. Stay left at next junction to then rejoin the overgrown road. Taking a right at this junction leads you past a crashed car in the trees. Stay straight for another mile, hopping across a few creeks then arrive at Hannan Creek, a large washout that has been leveled by machinery. Ford the creek--walking sticks left by other hikers can be of assistance here. <br><br>The trail to the falls branches off to the right on the other side of Hannan Creek. It may be hidden from view by a large dirt pile. Follow the sound of the falls, and shortly a firepit area is reached, which overlooks the falls. There is a short path leading to the base of the falls, a total of two and a half miles from the trailhead.</p>\n                 ",

First the bad: the Forest Service has stopped maintaining this trail.

More bad news: no maintenance also means that the trail is brushing in fast, and big blowdowns are also a hindrance to hikers. Possible good news: if hikers, horseback riders, mountain bikers, and yes, even motorcyclists could forge a partnership to keep this wonderful low-country trail open. It would be a great way to open dialogue between all of these different trail users too.<br><br>Begin in a nice grove of big ponderosa pine. Immediately meet up with the river and follow it upstream through a narrow canyon littered with big boulders. The tread is wide and lined with horsetails. Surrounding slopes and ledges are warmed by the sun, while a constant breeze cooled by the river&apos;s tumbling waters blows along the canyon floor. At 0.5 mile enter an old burn zone. Smatterings of ancient ponderosas-their bark resilient to scorching-stand defiantly along the frothing river.<br><br>Continue through the winding canyon. Willows and other brush grow thicker along the tread. Without maintenance soon, this trail will become impassable. At 1.5 miles Hornet Creek buzzes down into the river from the west. A long-abandoned trail (extremely difficult to follow), reached by fording the river, follows the creek westward along a parallel ridge. In springtime, look along the sun-kissed slopes here for Tweedy&apos;s lewisia, a showy flower endemic only to the Wenatchee Mountains, the Methow Valley, and British Columbia&apos;s Simalkameen Valley. Look too for rubber boas, a docile constrictor snake that is common in these parts.<br><br>Continue farther, passing nice lunch spots by mesmerizing rapids and in tranquil forest groves.

Cross the bridge and explore the trail east, with views upstream of Antoine Peak. The mansion at the top of the cliff is the former Royal Newton Riblet Mansion, now the Arbor Crest Winery. A mile upstream from the bridge, look for the statue of Antoine Plante on the far bank; this is the location where Plante operated his ferry across the Spokane River from the 1850s until the 1870s, and where the historic Mullan Trail crossed the Spokane River. <br><br>The best of the Centennial Trail can be found at the western end where it crosses into Riverside State Park.

    "desc": "\n                    This narrow wilderness trail follows the Chiwaukum Creek upstream to a junction with several other trails, providing opportunities for unbounded rambling in the winter wonderlands of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Most snowshoers, though, will find plenty of beautiful country, awesome views, and outstanding snowshoeing along the first 5 miles of the trail. The trail pierces pine and fir forests, nicely blanketed in pristine white snow. Along the way, snowshoers can gawk in wonder at the towering ramparts of Big Jim and Snowgrass Mountains. They can enjoy the musical stylings of Chiwaukum Creek as it bounds over ice-crusted boulders and snow-laden logs. And, unfortunately, they can skip the whole thing if the avalanche danger is moderate or higher. The last mile of the road to the summer trailhead and the first mile of trail are at the base of a steep, slide-prone slope and should only be crossed when the risk of avalanche is low or nonexistent. But if the conditions are right, this trail is not to be missed.<br><br>Chiwaukum Creek cuts through a narrow valley along its lower reaches. It is nearly flat, gaining just 1200 feet in more than 5 miles, and it pierces some of the most beautiful old forests of pine and fir in the region. The ponderosa pine is particularly pretty in this setting, with its bright-orange bark scales offsetting the brilliant white of the snow and the sparkling blue of the creek.<br><br>The trail rolls upstream, curving gently to the west and opening up views of McCue Ridge towering above the upper Chiwaukum Creek valley and Big Jim Mountain to the south. Numerous wide areas in the sheltering forests offer excellent sites in which to pitch a camp, and the possibilities of making an extended snowshoeing adventure out of this trip are endless. <br><br>At 5.2 miles the trail splits. This is where most of you will turn back, but if you are a hearty winter fanatic, consider pushing on into the deeper regions of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Do this only if you are adequately prepared for extended winter exposure.<br><br>At the trail fork, the path on the right climbs steeply to the Chiwaukum Lake and Larch Lake basins. This trail crosses several avalanche slopes and is best left for summer explorations. The left trail, though, follows the South Fork Chiwaukum River for 3 miles, passing several other trails along the way. Good campsites are found at Timothy Meadows, about 2 miles upstream from the original trail split.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope.\n                 ",

What is more, you&#x2019;ll hardly break a sweat in the easy climb of 250 feet to reach the tiered falls. And amazingly, you&apos;ll probably not have to put up with many other hikers along the way, as the trail is still relatively unknown.<br><br>The well-maintained Murhut Falls Trail begins with a gradual ascent, then flattens out before the final steep ascent to your destination at 1,050 feet. This is Pacific Rhododendron country, so if you hike this trail in spring you&#x2019;ll find yourself surrounded by pink bursts of bloom splashed against the surrounding green forest.

After 1 mile of gentle climbing, the trail enters The Brothers Wilderness Area. Drop 200 feet, and then follow an old logging railroad grade, cutting through a mossy wonderland on an almost perfectly flat path. A few remnant old firs greet you along the way. Finally, in about 2 miles, the river comes into view. A half mile farther delivers you to an absolutely gorgeous spot where emerald giant cedars and firs hang over rows of chugging white water. This mesmerizing spot is a good place to turn around if you don&apos;t feel inclined to make the 1000-foot climb up the Big Hump.<br><br>For hikers hankering to hike the Hump, the trail twists and turns using tight switchbacks to ascend this valley obstacle. Thanks to a southern exposure, madrona and manzanita can be found scattered beneath the fir and hemlock. At about 3.5 miles, emerge onto a ledge with a spectacular view east down the river and out to the Cascades. To the south, impressive St. Peters Dome hovers over the Hump. More spectacular than the view, however, is the spring floral show. Come here in April for batches of fawn lilies lining the ledges. In May, the rhodies flaunt their blossoms.<br><br>Feel like continuing? Encounter one more outcropping before cresting the Hump. Then, through impressive old growth, the way descends a much cooler north slope. In about 5.3 miles and after dropping 650 feet, the trail once again reaches the river level. Here, at a well-worn camping area near a series of impressive rapids, is a great spot to call it quits. Enjoy the view. Watch for darting dippers.

It&apos;s a rocky, brushy affair and, depending on water flow, wet as well.<br><br>The worst of this gauntlet is next. The route leaves the creek, ascending straight up the wall of the narrow draw. It&apos;s steep but not exposed. Using your hands and &quot;spider strength,&quot;scale up the abrupt slope. Occasionally look back at The Brothers hovering in the distance.

The forest thins and good views of the Chiwaukums and Big Jim Mountain are to be had from this long broad ridge once used as pasture for William McCue&apos;s sheep flocks.<br><br>After ambling easily along the ridge, begin a long descent, dropping 700 feet to a junction on the wooded shores of Chiwaukum Lake (elev. 5250 ft). One mile long and perched at the head of a hanging valley, the lake is a favorite destination for backpackers, anglers, and day hikers abandoning plans to pursue Larch Lake.<br><br>For the Larch-bound, carry on to the right, entering the stunning Ewing Basin in a short mile. The word Chiwaukum is derived from the Wenatchee dialect meaning &quot;many little creeks running into one big one.&quot; Look around-a most appropriate name indeed for these mountains. After rock-hopping over a couple of those creeks, leave the basin to climb a small rib rife with larch.<br><br>At 6 miles enter a glorious high meadow spread out before sparkling Larch Lake (elev. 6078 ft). Beautiful in summer, the lake and its environs are resplendent in autumn when low-lying blueberry bushes carpet the basin crimson and crag-clinging larches illuminate it with a golden glow.</p>\n                 ",

Sylvester (see &quot;Sly Sylvester&quot; in the Lake Wenatchee section) for various acquaintances, none of whom hailed from Scotland, the surrounding boggy and meadowed high slopes do, however, bear a slight resemblance to the Scottish moors. Easily reached from High Camp, Julius and Eileen extend a hearty f&#xC3;&#xA1;ilte to all hikers, young and old alike.<br><br>From High Camp take the Summer Trail, which takes off from behind the main lodge and immediately enters national forest land. Come to a junction with the Sunset Trail at 0.2 mile and continue right. Through cool forest, the Summer Trail quickly gains elevation. At 0.5 mile veer right onto the Low Road Trail and follow it for 0.5 mile to its end at the McCue Ridge Trail (elev. 5600 ft). Left heads up and over McCue to Chiwaukum and Larch lakes. Go right.<br><br>Soon come to a signed junction. The way right is the old Roaring Creek Trail that once traveled for miles through unbroken forest to the Nason Creek valley. It became a logging casualty in the 1980s. Continue left through pleasant old growth. Cross a small creek and slowly descend, coming to the end of a logging road at 1.75 miles (elev. 5350 ft). The logging road offers a 1.5-mile, slightly easier alternative route back to High Camp.<br><br>The trail veers back into the forest, where it continues to descend. Soon after entering the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the way bottoms out along Roaring Creek, which lets out nary a growl here within a peaceful flat (elev. 5150 ft). After carefully crossing the creek on a set of logs that shift each year, reach a junction. The trail right leads 2.5 lonely and scenic miles to Lake Ethel.<br><br>Take the more boot-beaten path left, reaching Lake Julius (elev. 5200 ft) in a mere 0.25 mile (2.5 miles from your start). A shallow lake ringed with handsome forest and a rugged backdrop of McCue Ridge, it&apos;s a pleasant destination for picnicking or for calling it a day. If intent on seeing Eileen, however, continue. Skirt Julius&apos;s shoreline, and then climb a series of ledges to reach the bowl-bound Loch Eileen at 3.5 miles (elev. 5508 ft).<br><br>Fed by waterfalls tumbling over steep headwalls and surrounded by rocky slopes and groves of larches, Eileen sits in a dramatically different environment than its lower cousin Julius. Particularly striking in autumn, Eileen also has a nice appeal during hot summer days, when shoreline ledges invite foot-soaking.</p>\n                 ",

When you come upon one of these solitary giants, reflect that trees of that size once were common in Northwest forests.<br><br>At first the trail is reasonably level, although that will change. In 0.9 miles come to a one-lane bridge across the West Fork of the Foss River, and pause to admire the stream. When you contemplate the steep grade, and the size of the tree trunks strewn along the rocky banks, you can understand how an earlier bridge was destroyed by flood waters and debris. The replacement bridge seems sturdy enough, and high enough, to survive for a while.<br><br>Continue on another 0.7 mile, with some uphill, and reach Trout Lake. Hikers or backpackers seeking an easier day may choose to stop here. The lake is in a pleasant forested setting, with several potential campsites, and there is a view looking up past the lake to some of the high country beyond. If you plan to continue on as far as Big Heart Lake, your route will take you up onto those heights, and you will have a view looking back down at Trout Lake.<br><br>The trail passes around the west side of Trout Lake, then begins to climb in earnest, gaining 1900 feet in less than two miles on a very rocky route. It has many switchbacks but not a lot of shade, so it&apos;s easy to get overheated here on a sunny afternoon. This is good incentive to start your hike early.<br><br>There aren&apos;t many wildflowers along this slope, but in summer you are likely to find pearly everlasting, a trace of yarrow, and some fireweed. As you climb, the sound of rushing water is always close by, and you will have occasional glimpses of the white rapids. Near the top of the switchbacks, an impressive cascade comes into full view. It&apos;s the outlet stream from Copper Lake plunging over the headwall.<br><br>Eventually you&apos;ll get above the cascade and come to a trail fork where a weathered sign indicates the way to Lake Malachite. Whatever your goal for today, don&apos;t rule out a side trip to Lake Malachite. It&apos;s just over 0.1 mile to the lake, with a somewhat stony climb of about 100 feet on rudimentary trail. Lake Malachite is a very pretty lake, particularly in morning light. You might even find a campsite along the eastern edge. Climbers intent on summiting 6,261-foot Malachite Peak sometimes bivouac here.<br><br>If you are going on, return 0.1 mile to the main trail and continue another 0.3 miles to reach Copper Lake, crossing the outlet stream on a picturesque group of secure boulders. Copper Lake is somewhat larger than Lake Malachite but in a similar setting, and there are good options for campsites along the northern shore.<br><br>Many day-hikers choose to turn around at Copper Lake, but the trail does go on. Follow a rocky trail along the eastern shore of Copper Lake, with some ups and downs, then head gently uphill toward Little Heart Lake. In summer, you might find blueberries or thimbleberries beside the trail, although they disappear quickly, thanks to wildlife and your fellow hikers. A few wildflowers bloom here, even a bit of beargrass, and there are some potential campsites along the way. Little Heart Lake itself is 1.3 miles from the outlet of Copper Lake, and it&apos;s about the size of Trout Lake. It has a very rocky shoreline, but you might be able to find some camping options near the outlet.<br><br>Beyond Little Heart Lake there is more elevation to be gained, about 700 feet in 1.1 miles, that will bring you to a high point. From there you can look back down on Trout Lake, and glimpse Glacier Peak looming dramatically in the distance. Also below, and off to the right, is Delta Lake.<br><br>Big Heart Lake is about 0.7 miles beyond the high point, and about 300 feet lower-elevation you will have to regain on your return. But press on, it&apos;s worth it. The trail descends gently, with an occasional switchback, then levels out and reaches a point overlooking the lake and its outlet stream. There is room for a few campers here, and there is a great view looking south up the lake. <br><br>It&apos;s possible to scramble across the log jam at the lake outlet and continue on rudimentary trails to reach Angeline Lake and other lakes. Check your map for possibilities. But you are 7.3 miles from the trailhead, and if you are a day-hiker then Big Heart Lake may be a good place to turn around. If you are a backpacker, you can set up camp at Big Heart Lake, and enjoy additional explorations the following day.</p>\n                 ",

The challenging climb into the Necklace Valley well-rewards hearty hikers with cool alpine lakes named for precious gems that you can swim, fish in, or just camp beside. <br><br>The trail begins gently along the East Fork Foss River, traversing through a beautiful, naturally-regenerated forest that was logged by the railroads in the 1930s. The first five miles gain only 600 feet. Lowland forest wildflowers will keep your senses busy - look for trillium, calypso orchids, and yellow violets and more. This pleasant stroll abruptly ends when you come to the crossing of the East Fork Foss River. There is an established campsite here, and this is a good turn-around for a day hike of the East Fork Foss.<br><br>Depending on the condition of the footlog and the amount of snowmelt in the river below, the crossing can be a little scary. Hold on to the handwire.  After the crossing, the hike changes considerably as it becomes a steep, grueling climb, gaining 2400 feet in just 3 miles until you reach the first of the gems - Jade Lake. It&apos;s nice and peaceful, and there are established campsites here, but you will be amply rewarded if you push on to Emerald or Locket Lake. Be prepared for insects.<br><br>Enjoy a few days exploring up here, scrambling over granite, breathing in the fragrant mountain heather, and relaxing in the shade of forest. No campfires are allowed, so be sure and pack your backcountry stove.<br><br>From the cabin, a trail climbs, then drops west to Al Lake. There is a maze of social trails in this area.<br><br>The upper end of this hanging valley accesses La Bohn Lakes and the standard route on Mt. Hinman. This is most pleasant as a snow ascent in early season, but the snow chute to the gap requires an ice axe. Once the snow is gone, Hinman is very rocky.  In late season, follow the left edge of the talus as high as possible, then work left on a discernible scramble track that generally follows the right side of the La Bohn Lakes&apos; outfall.<br><br>Necklace Valley also accesses the Tank/Foehn Lakes areas. Ascend the very rocky, cairned medial moraine up this huge, recently glaciated cirque. Might be easiest in early season on snow. Please treat the fragile high country very carefully.<br><br>For an adventurous hike one may continue from Tank Lakes in a generally south-westerly direction towards Iron Cap Mountain. Fred Beckey shows this route as the Alpine Lakes High Route (see Cascade Alpine Guide, #1, second edition, page 188). One may circumvent ICM to the north or go over it (both routes have their pros and cons and neither are simple). At ones discretion, descend to either Otter Lake or Big Heart Lake on fisherman&apos;s trails. From either one may gain the West Fork of the Foss River. This trail will join Road #68 just one mile south of where your car is parked at the east fork trailhead! Note that your mileage will increase to 22-26 miles with ~6500 in elevation gain.</p>\n                 ",

The trail weaves through beautiful old-growth forest along the bottom of a wide river valley for much of its length before turning near-vertical to climb into a high alpine lakes basin. Those looking for a gentle stretch of the legs and a quiet snowy camp can call it a day at the bottom of the steep climb, while the &quot;no pain, no gain&quot; crowd can muscle their way up the slick slopes and right to the edge of the lakes before pitching camp for a well-deserved rest. Either way, enjoy wonderful scenery, stunning views, and a quiet solitude seldom experienced in the popular Alpine Lakes Wilderness.<br><br>Snowshoe up the road as it gently climbs alongside the Foss River. The first mile is a multiple-use winter recreation area, so expect to see, or maybe just hear, snowmobiles along this section. But once past the Tonga Ridge Road (FR 6830) junction, the route is reserved for nonmotorized recreation, so plan on peace and quiet for the remainder of the journey. <br><br>At 1.8 miles from the parking lot, leave the wide roadway by climbing off the left side of the road onto the Foss River Trail. This narrow wilderness path follows the east bank of the East Fork Foss River for 5 miles. The trail is generally easy to follow, and is fairly flat and gentle, making easy going for snowshoers of all abilities. It was, in fact, once the route of a narrow-gauge railroad that steamed up and down the valley hauling ore out of mine claims and supplies up to the hardrock miners. But this trip is not all just boring trail walking. Along this stretch of trail there are countless opportunities for you to dip down into riverside meadows to explore the snowy landscape and the water&apos;s edge--just be careful not to get too close to the river&apos;s edge. <br><br>The river valley is wide and beautiful with enough openings in the old-growth forest to allow views up toward the jagged peaks of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Bald Eagle Peak towers over the western valley wall while glacier-studded Mount Daniel fills the sky to the southeast. Look straight up the valley to see the 7899-foot mountain as well as its neighbor, 7492-foot Mount Hinman.<br><br>Numerous fine campsites are all along this stretch of the trail, but the best are in the broad riverside meadows about 5 miles from your car, and again at 6.8 miles, where the trail suddenly veers west away from the river and climbs steeply into the high lakes basin of Necklace Valley. This corner near the river, with good views all around, and good selection of campsites in the surrounding forest, is the end of the road for all but the most fanatic snowshoers. <br><br>If you want to push your skills and endurance to the limits, and if the avalanche danger is low, struggle up the last 2.5 miles of trail as it climbs some 2200 feet to reach the lower lakes in the Necklace chain. The payoff is great, with the wide lakes basin, deep snow bowls, and awesome views of the major Alpine Lakes peaks. However, the expense is extreme physical exertion in an area highly prone to avalanche danger. <br><br>It&apos;s much more enjoyable to skip the last leg of the trail and simply bask in the glorious beauty of the winter wilderness environment of the East Fork Foss River. Save the high alpine lakes for summer hikes.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful.

Forget about the busy highway and the railroad as you enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in a quarter mile. Just a little farther down the trail, cross Deception Creek on a beautiful log bridge. With carved steps leading to a wide footbridge with a hand railing, kids will love this one! Across the creek, large boulders make a nice place to rest and throw rocks in the water.<br><br>Once across the creek, continue hiking through magnificent old-growth forest. The trail leaves the river now and heads up and over the cliff. You can hear the river below as you switchback up through moss-covered boulders and ferny undergrowth. This mossy forest floor is home to many types of plants. Look for the showy white flowers of trillium in spring. <br><br>In addition to the more traditionally recognizable flowers, plants with no chlorophyll that live on decaying organic matter thrive here. Watch for a ground-hugging leaf with a white stripe down the middle: the rattlesnake orchid. Come back in the summer and look for its bloom, tubular white flowers on a short stalk. The forest floor also is home to a colorful saprophyte called pine drops, whose flowers are salmon-yellow urn shaped flowers on an orange stem. Another saprophyte, pinesap, is similar in color but shorter. In the fall this same forest floor will also support a variety of mushrooms. <br><br>The trail drops down a little to a nice campsite, and short of three miles, there will be another log footbridge. Cross the bridge over Sawyer creek and notice the abundance of huckleberry bushes. Pick a few to add to pancakes. If you&apos;re camping, this is a reminder to bearproof your food in your site-they like the berries as much as you do.<br><br>Continue on as the trail takes a gentle up and down course along the ridge. As you approach the river again, listen for the loud roaring sound that indicates a waterfall. The river falls in several short steps, reaches a narrow chasm, then churns through it. Picture time! Play with your camera settings and try to capture it in motion, but be careful when lining up the shot; the drop off is steep and the moss slippery. <br><br>Once you pass the waterfall the trail drops down, breaks out of the woods and into an old avalanche ravine. Here may be some views of the surrounding peaks, if the weather is cooperating. Keep heading down along the flats and reach the river again in five and a half miles. There will be a trail junction and a sign. The right side climbs the ridge to Sawyer Pass and Tonga Ridge. Follow the left fork to some nice campsites along the river.

Hikers, snowshoers, birders and mountain bikers alike could potentially spot red-tail hawk soaring overhead, listen to pileated woodpeckers at work on surrounding trees, come across signs of the resident white-tailed deer,  moose, and elk populations, or spot such locally rare trees as Pacific yew. <br><br>The west side access offers the most direct route to the summit of Antione Peak, and also boasts a &#x201C;necklace&#x201D; route that travels around the base of the peak at approximately the 3000-foot level. This access point offers the best views of the Spokane Valley. From the trailhead it climbs for just under a mile to an overlook to the west.

Here there will be some way paths leading to views over the ridge. <br><br>Take in the views, then descend gradually and the trees begin the thin out. Some &#x2018;peek-a-boo&#x2019; views of the nearby mountains can now be glimpsed through the gaps in the forest. Follow the trail as it meanders gently up and down along the ridgeline, then arrive at a little meadow filled with lupine and heather. Can you smell it? On warm days, blooming lupine perfumes the trail. <br><br>Once past the meadow, be on the lookout for an unmarked, but obvious trail taking off steeply to the left at about two miles. There may or may not be a cairn at this junction, which is for the trail to Mount Sawyer. Great views and more wildflower meadows await you here. Like any self-respecting trail to a peak, this one begins steeply and traverses across the south side on its way up. As it reaches the summit, it circles around to the north side, becoming very narrow and hard to follow through the heather and white rhododendron, beautiful if in bloom.<br><br>Try not to step on the plants. Find rocks and worn tread to take you to the top. There is a geological survey marker giving the elevation at the summit: 5,495 feet. Once at the top, it&#x2019;s three hundred and sixty degrees of Cascade Mountains! Glacier Peak is to the north and just to the west of it is Mt Baker poking up in the distance. Mount Rainier is to the south, Mount Baring to the west, plus close-ups of Hinman, Daniel and other Alpine Lake peaks. How many can you identify? Look to the east and see Stevens Pass curving through the valley and the eastern Cascades in the background. Wow! <br><br>Once you are done feasting on the views, it may be time to head downward to look for a lunch spot. Meet the main trail and follow it another mile to Sawyer Pass. A flat open area amid the trees, there are some nice lunch logs and a few places to camp. Enjoy your lunch amid the heather and huckleberries, but bring water. Once the snow melts there is no water on this trail. A trail sign indicates the main trail continues down to Deception Creek. To the right is an unmarked side trail which leads to a few dead ends, then wanders around a bit before becoming a brushy, unmaintained trail down to Fisher Lake. <br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: Come for the berries and fall color, but remember to wear bright colors and make some noise.

At the time it was built, it was considered the best engineered of the transcontinental railroads. Your journey will take you on one of the intricate switchbacks that once started trains up the Cascades Mountains. <br><br>Start out at the Martin Creek trailhead, and here you will now find a wonderful trail for hikers with physical challenges. The first part of this loop contains almost three miles of ADA accessible trail, and it is both interesting and beautiful. It is a wide gravel trail with wooden bridges across small creeks making the journey easy on wheelchairs. Admire the small waterfalls coming down. There are several old tunnels with trails going up to the opening, and collapsed timbers that once were protection from the snow. Note the dates stamped in the concrete at the entrance of the tunnels. Many of the tunnels and snow bridges were built after the Wellington Avalanche Disaster to better protect the trains from snow. Pause and read the interpretive signs in front, but the tunnels are unsafe to enter! <br><br>There are more than tunnels and timber to tell the rail story. Interpretive signs along the way also tell of the people that built the railway.

You can go to the right and on to the Wellington trailhead for a longer hike, adding almost six miles to your total. For a nice lunch stop and good views of Stevens Pass, surrounding peaks and the present railroad line, take the right trail for just a quarter of a mile to the Windy Point viewpoint. There are some nice lunch rocks and if you are lucky, you might hear, or see pikas. <br><br>To make the loop and return to Martin Creek, take the left upper trail, a rougher trail than the lower one. This trail will take you by the remnants of several snow sheds. There are usually waterfalls coming off the top of some of them. Notice the signs beside the trail with numbers, these are the miles to (or from) Chicago, where the railroad originated. It is worth taking the Spillway Spur stairs just to see where the old reservoir once was. The new Cascade Tunnel was opened in 1929 and the old grade abandoned. Perhaps you can hear the whistle of a train climbing over the mountains even now. Follow the Martin Creek crossover back to your car.<br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: Read &#x2018;The White Cascade&#x2019; by Gary Krist, an account of the Wellington Avalanche Disaster, then hike the rest of the trail to the Wellington trailhead with a deeper appreciation of history and our Cascade mountain weather.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Carkeek Park is located in northwest Seattle, between 3rd Ave NW and Puget Sound. The park includes all of Piper&apos;s Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.<br><br>The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper&apos;s Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.<br><br>Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. <br><br>Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers&apos; former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.<br><br>Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There&apos;s a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. <br><br>The Piper&apos;s Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper&apos;s Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.<br><br>In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper&apos;s Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper&apos;s Creek.<br><br>As you continue down the Piper&apos;s Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.<br><br>You will pass Piper&apos;s Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.<br><br>As you proceed down Piper&apos;s Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper&apos;s Creek.<br><br>Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.<br><br>Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It&apos;s worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.<br><br>After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper&apos;s Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.<br><br>In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper&apos;s Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the &quot;flavor&quot; of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper&apos;s Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank.<br> <br>Unless you are returning to the Piper&apos;s Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.<br><br>The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. <br><br>Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper&apos;s Creek.<br><br>The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.<br><br>Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.<br><br>A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.<br><br>Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper&apos;s Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper&apos;s Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.<br><br>Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. <br><br>Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper&apos;s Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper&apos;s Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper&apos;s Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way.</p>\n                 ",

If you don&apos;t stop for a bite to eat in one of the neighborhoods along the way, Gasworks Park (on the north side of the loop) and Lake Union Park (on the south side) both make great picnic spots with lake views.<br><br>There are multiple access points for the Cheshiahud Lake Union Loop, but the most convenient parking is to be found at GasWorks Park at the north end of Lake Union, between the neighborhoods of Fremont and Wallingford. <br><br>Starting here, head east along a gravel path that parallels North Pacific Street, before bearing left onto the Burke Gilman Trail. This parallels NE Pacific Street and crosses under the I-5 bridge along NE 40th before crossing the Lake Washington bridge just south of the U-District. The bridge is a great spot to stop and watch boat traffic, or get photos of the bridge itself -- it&apos;s quite photogenic. <br><br>Once you&apos;re across the bridge, make a right and head down towards the lake. You&apos;ll pass South Passage Point Park, one of the many pocket parks along this route. Despite being right under I-5, this secret spot makes for a nice place to sit and take in this corner of the lake before continuing on. <br><br>The next section of the route winds its way through neighborhoods and business districts in Eastlake. Fortunately, the path is very well-signed, just keep an eye out for red directional signposts topped with arrows marked &quot;Cheshiahud Lake Union Loop&quot; pointing the way. The trail is for public use, but remember that you&apos;re passing private property; please be respectful of the folks who call this place home. <br><br>From the neighborhoods and businesses of Eastlake, round the south end of the lake by taking Valley Street, then ducking into Lake Union Park. Here you&apos;re a little more than halfway done. The Museum of History and Industry provides a great distraction here, and some places to sit and contemplate the lake are available. However, this section of the loop is also quite close to the &quot;Mercer Mess&quot;, a section of road in Seattle that nearly always has lots of traffic. You&apos;re probably better off continuing on in search of quiet. <br><br>Once you&apos;ve followed the trail around the southern tip of the lake, you&apos;ll be paralleling Westlake Avenue, a business district. What it lacks in pocket parks, this section of the trail makes up for in street ends that provide overlooks, including the Galer Street End near the large pedestrian bridge roughly a third of a mile from the end of the lake, as well as Blaine, Crockett, and McGraw street ends, in order from south to north. <br><br>Follow Westlake Avenue all the way to an intersection with Fremont Ave and Nickerson, where the trail crosses the Fremont Bridge. This funky blue and orange bridge is the gateway to the self-professed &quot;Center of the Universe&quot; neighborhood. Once you&apos;ve crossed the bridge, you&apos;ve got about a mile left.<br><br>Turn right off the bridge. After one block you&apos;ll pass under Highway 99. A two-block, uphill detour here on Troll Avenue will take you to one of Seattle&apos;s iconic destinations, the Fremont Troll. He&apos;s worth a visit if you&apos;re in the neighborhood! Back on the Cheshiahud Loop, rejoin the Burke Gilman Trail, passing the Fremont Brewery on the left and some peek-a-boo views of Lake Union on the right.<br><br>The last leg of the trail dips back to parallel N Northlake Way, depositing you right back in the same parking lot you departed from. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Just across from Gas Works park are the Wallingford Steps, south of the end of Wallingford Avenue (between Densmore and Burke Avenue).

It offers some environmental displays, indoor restrooms, an information desk and trail maps. <br><br>Find your trailhead next to a signboard at the north end of the parking lot. The board has a park map, and often has paper copies of the trail map available for the taking. Trail maps can also be downloaded: see the Maps and Guidebooks section of this entry for the link. <br><br>Two additional trailheads are mentioned below. Since this is a loop hike, they could be considered as alternative starting points. For more details, see the Driving Directions. <br><br>From the signboard, head north on the trail, first going down a few steps, then hiking gently uphill for 100 yards to reach the Loop Trail. You can hike the Loop in either direction, although many think views are better if you begin by going left here. <br><br>Climb a very short steep section, then level out and drop a bit. Cross a paved road--one of many dating from the military era, now used only by park vehicles. Climb some more. Here, and in all forested areas of the park, be alert for the tapping sounds of woodpeckers, including the large pileated woodpeckers sometimes seen in the park.<br><br>For the next quarter mile the trail heads generally south, eventually leveling out and bending around to the west. Along the way, in late winter, you might see the white blossoms of Indian plum, a scraggly shrub that is the first to blossom each year. In the spring, you might see the bright yellow blossoms of Oregon grape or the red blooms of wild currant. Later bloomers are the native salmonberry and thimble berry.<br><br>Here, and in other forested areas along the Loop Tail, tall trees sometimes fall during wind storms. You may notice a few large trunks of trees that have met that end. In 2005, a large maple tree in the park was struck by lightning and literally exploded. So dynamic events do happen here, although hopefully not during your hike.<br><br>Pass by the South Parking Lot, an alternative access point for the Loop Trail, reached from W Emerson Street. Then continue on west next to the access road and soon reach the highest point on the Loop Trail. A sign points right toward a viewpoint near the old chapel that looks out over the South Meadow. You can check it out if you like. Then return to the Loop Trail, drop a bit, cross a park road and approach the meadow.<br><br>In winter, you may be lucky to see a rare arctic snowy owl near this end of the meadow. In summer or fall, scan the trees to the north of the meadow for red-tail or Cooper&apos;s hawks.<br><br>While great blue herons generally hunt for fish in the shallows near the shore, when fishing is not good a heron may fly up to the meadow to hunt mice. If you see a heron standing completely still in the tall grass, it&apos;s waiting for lunch.<br><br>Bald eagles also prefer fish, so they usually cruise along the shore or perch high in a tree overlooking the water. But their flight paths sometimes are visible from the Loop Trail so as you cross the meadow, be alert for eagle sightings.<br><br>The trail continues near the southern edge of the meadow where a short side trail leads left to a restroom facility. The views along the trail improve with every step, with the Olympic Mountains visible in the distance across Puget Sound. To the north of the meadow, a large radar dome is visible. It&apos;s an FAA radar that tracks commercial flights.<br><br>You&apos;ll approach a sandy area. It&apos;s not a desert, but sand does accumulate there, blown up over the bluff by prevailing winds. Loop around the north edge of the sand dune and, in summer, note the large stand of fireweed blooming just off the trail.<br><br>Before you reach the next trees, a bench offers a great view toward the south end of Puget Sound, with parts of Magnolia and West Seattle visible. If clouds permit, you may see Mount Rainier in the distance.<br><br>Hike a short way beneath the trees and come to a headland that offers some of the best views in the park. Take a few minutes to appreciate it all. But take note: the bluff here is unstable and slides do occur, so it&apos;s best not to approach the edge too closely.<br><br>As you leave the viewpoint, a side trail heads off to the left and leads a half-mile down to South Beach and the West Point Lighthouse. Continue on the Loop Trail, now heading north. Soon the trail forks. The left fork is the official Loop Trail. The right fork follows a metal fence and soon reconnects with the Loop Trail. Unless you have a fondness for hiking next to fences, take the left fork.<br><br>Come to Discovery Park Boulevard, a road that provides access to the West Point Sewage Treatment Plant. Appropriately, a portable toilet generally sits beside the Loop Trail just before you come to the road crossing. <br><br>Cross the road, continue following the trail next to the road, then head down through a forested area to reach the much smaller North Meadow. Here, the Hidden Valley Trail heads off to the left and provides another route to the beach. Climb a bit on the Loop Trail, and cross two paved old roads. The second one is shown on the trail map as Kansas Avenue.<br><br>Beyond Kansas Avenue, the Loop Trail winds through two heavily forested canyons. In some years, barred owls are seen here and along the next half-mile of the trail. The owls generally are not active during the day, and if seen at all they will be dozing part way up a tree. An exception is during nesting season, when the owls can become aggressive. Sometimes hikers or joggers are buzzed by an owl, or may even be rapped on the scalp by a talon. The owls seem particularly troubled by any person sporting a ponytail or headphones.<br><br>Continue on the Loop Trail. Along the way, a side trail heads downhill to the left to reach the North Parking Lot, another access point for this hike. Farther along, come to Illinois Avenue, where a second trail also heads downhill to the North Parking Lot. <br><br>Cross Illinois Avenue with caution. It&apos;s a public road between the Visitor Center and the North Parking Lot. The crossing is well-marked, but not all drivers are alert for hikers.<br><br>Along the next part of the Loop Trail, you might catch a view of Mount Baker off to the north.<br><br>A quarter mile farther along, a veteran&apos;s cemetery is visible though the trees. Soon, the Loop Trail passes though a tunnel under W Government Way and you will and find yourself back at the trail junction where you began the Loop Trail. The parking lot and Visitor Center are just a short stroll away.<br><br>With luck, you will have had some interesting bird sightings on your hike. The Seattle Audubon Society lists 270 species sometimes seen in the park, or just offshore.<br><br>While birds are abundant here, you may not have seen any wild critters larger than a squirrel. There are raccoons in the park, but they are mostly nocturnal, like the smaller resident mountain beavers, so they are not often seen. But occasionally larger fauna have found their way to Discovery Park, perhaps by following the railroad tracks. In early 2008, a coyote was a park resident for several weeks. In May 2009, a black bear was spotted at least passing through the park, if not actually residing there. In September 2009, reports of a mountain lion sighting in the park were greeted with skepticism. But they persisted, and soon a lion was tracked, treed, tranquilized and transported, we hope to a happier habitat. So you never know. When you hike the Loop Trail bring your camera and be alert for surprises. Enjoy whatever you do see.<br><br>A Brief History of the Area<br>In 1898, the War Department wanted an army base in the Puget Sound area to protect against any future naval invasion. It had been less than 40 years since US and British forces almost clashed over a disputed border in the San Juan Islands. Fortunately, that 1859 conflict was quickly defused. Only a single shot was fired and that was by a civilian. The only casualty was a pig.<br><br>While the military had their own motivations, local communities saw a large military base as an opportunity for economic gain. Also, it was hoped in some quarters that the army might be enlisted to help in the event of civil unrest. Labor disputes, in particular, were common in that era. Though there was considerable rivalry between Seattle and Tacoma to see which city would host the army base, Seattle won. The city had to offer the land to the military for free, after buying out a few landowners who already owned plots there.<br><br>The fort opened in 1900, and was named in honor of Major General Henry Lawton, a recent casualty of the Philippine-American conflict who had fought in earlier wars and in 1886 had played a prominent role in the capture of Apache Chief Geronimo. Fort Lawton never became the major army post local boosters hoped for. The garrison remained small, and it languished even more as time went on. At the height of the great depression, in 1938, the Army offered to sell Fort Lawton back to Seattle for only one dollar. The city declined, citing concerns about potential maintenance costs.<br><br>During the Second World War, Fort Lawton was revived as an embarkation point for thousands of soldiers and tons of material headed to the South Pacific or to the Aleutians. Also, the Fort hosted a prisoner-of-war camp that held over 1000 German prisoners. During the Korean War of 1950-53, the Fort enjoyed another bustle of activity.<br><br>In the 1950s, Nike anti-aircraft missile batteries were installed at Fort Lawton, and elsewhere in the Puget Sound area. A hardened missile control center that coordinated all the local batteries was located at the Fort. But within a few years those weapons were obsolete. Later, Fort Lawton was proposed as a launch site for inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs,) but that plan never materialized. <br><br>In 1973, much of Fort Lawton was returned to the city of Seattle to become Discovery Park, although the Army Reserve did maintain a presence there until 2012. It was the long army tenure that eventually made the park possible, since the area otherwise would likely have become suburban housing.</p>\n                 ",

Visitors here can wander gravel trails, paved pathways, and boardwalks, enjoying sights such as an operational blueberry farm, Mercer Slough, wetlands and wildlife, Lake Washington, and the Eastside Heritage Center at Winters House. The Heritage Trail near Winters House takes hikers along a trail that parallels blueberry fields old greenhouses and near an abandoned rhododendron garden. Another berry patch, the Mercer Slough Blueberry Farm, has trailhead parking, restrooms, even blueberries you can pick!<br><br>The Mercer Environmental Education Center holds classes on ecology and environmental education, and the Winters House is a Visitor Center complete with interpretive exhibits, restrooms, trailhead parking, and rental facilities, where you can rent a canoe to try out the Canoe Trail. This water trail gives visitors a new view of the Mercer Slough. Those more inclined to dry land can try the Bellefields Trail, which winds through upland forest, wetlands, and open meadow habitats to the edge of the slough channel.<br><br>A paved trail appropriately named the Periphery Trail circles the park, acting as part of the Lake Washington Bike Loop and the Mountains to Sound Greenway.

Come in spring for flowers, fall for color, and anytime to take a short trip back into time. For railroad and history buffs, the Tumwater Pipeline Trail is an outdoor museum.<br><br>When the Great Northern Railway abandoned its route over Stevens Pass and opted to go under the pass instead, its exhaust-emitting steam engines proved problematic in the long tunnel. So the line switched over to electric engines between Skykomish and Leavenworth. The railroad built a dam on the Wenatchee River (the dam is still there about 3 miles upriver from the trailhead) and ran a pipeline (penstock) down to a generating plant to produce electricity for the locomotives. In 1956 the railroad switched to diesel, abandoning the pipeline and power plant.<br><br>The trail starts at the site of the power plant, where parts of the foundation remain. Head off through a pine grove graced with big boulders and soon come to what no doubt will be the most popular feature on this hike for many, an old iron bridge spanning the river. Built to carry the pipeline across the water, the bridge offers exhilarating viewing of the Wenatchee River. Come in spring to watch kayakers and rafters riding the rapids. But be prepared for a wet crossing early in the season, when deep pools of water collect on the bridge.<br><br>Once across, follow the gentle trail along the river through Tumwater Canyon. Cottonwoods and maples adorn the trail and add touches of gold and crimson come October. At about 0.5 mile rock-hop across a side creek. Pass by big boulders and nice sandy beaches on the river. But before you&apos;re tempted to soak in the crystal waters, be forewarned. The word Tumwater is derived from Chinook Jargon, meaning strong or falling water. This is not an understatement here. In the summer of 2006 two teenagers swimming in the river were swept away and drowned. It&apos;s best not to soak more than feet in the powerful Wenatchee.<br><br>As you continue upriver, pass through pleasant pine groves-peaceful if not for the churn of the river and the hum of zooming vehicles on the opposite bank. Across the river, Castle Rock, a craggy protruding thumb favored by rock climbers, soon comes into view. Admire it and the clambering souls trying to subdue it.

The falls have their source in the drainage of Dutch Henry Draw to the northwest, and beyond that, far up at McCarteney Creek. Dusty Hill Falls thunders down the coulee walls briefly during spring runoff, but by early summer the falls is as dry as the great Dry Falls to the northeast.<br><br>As noted, the trail splits away from the falls in both directions, providing full access to the pristine basin of Moses Coulee.

Hawks of many species soar over this area as well.<br><br>Heading out along the southern trail, you&apos;ll find yourself entering a forest of towering sagebrush about a mile from the falls. These 8-foot tall sage bushes are the desert version of old growth forest. The massive sage plants are several centuries old.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>This hike will have limited access during the three-year Middle Fork Road paving project (summers 2014-2016). Learn more about the project here - http://www.wta.org/middleforkupdates<br><br>The way to Goldmyer Hot Springs is a delightful forest walk through deep woods, along the rushing Snoqualmie River, and ultimately to a beautiful hot springs tucked against the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Because it is privately owned by a non-profit, reservations are strongly recommended and are the only way to assure access to the property and hot springs. The caretakers will turn away visitors without reservations if they meet their 20 person a day limit. Visit www.goldmyer.org for more information on reservations and access.<br><br>There are several ways to get to Goldmyer Hot Springs, including beginning at the parking lot for the Pratt Connector Trail and taking the trail for the Middle Fork Snoqualmie upstream. When the Middle Fork paving project is complete, this will be the easiest way to get there. <br><br>From the Middle Fork parking lot, cross a beautiful, large bridge over the mighty Snoqualmie River and turn left. The trail stays close to the river, ducking in and out of the adjoining woods. At points, due to erosion, the trail threatens to slump into the river, but the way is never impossible to navigate. Eventually though, the trail turns away from the river and continues on through beautiful second-growth forest. <br><br>It&#x2019;s hard to believe that these trees are a second-generation&#x2013;-soaring high above your head, they are draped by mosses, much like old-growth. The effect is very peaceful and conducive to deep thinking or meditation as you walk along a trail springy from layers of pine needles that carpet the forest floor. <br><br>Six miles in, come to a junction where a sign points to Goldmyer Hot Springs and Dutch Miller Gap straight ahead. To the left, another trail branches off, crossing a large bridge. Less than half a mile down this trail is a different access point for Goldmyer; the parking lot for Dingford. From the parking lot, bicyclists can also access Goldmyer Hot Springs via an old road. Hikers can walk this road too, but the trail unfolding before you is many times more scenic than the old road, and the road to the Dingford parking lot is as bad, if not worse, than the Middle Fork Road of old. <br><br>Take the trail pointing towards Goldmyer and enter even more enchanting forest. The trail bobs up and down along an ever-calming Snoqualmie River as you hike past old- and second- growth forest dripping with mosses. Enormous boulders laced with lichen and hugged by tree roots growing over them inspire the imagination, and there is still the springy trail to enjoy. <br><br>Pass several dispersed campsites, scattered with artifacts from when this was still an active logging area, and four miles in, come to another junction. A trail here branches off, marked for Rock Creek. This is yet another way to access Goldmyer, but it is steep, steep, steep, and frequently choked with blowdowns due to the difficulty that any trail maintenance crew has getting back here. Carry on past this junction. This section of trail looks the most like the old road that it once was, but it hardly detracts from the lush surroundings, and the quiet. <br><br>A series of creek crossings of increasing difficulty are required to reach Goldmyer this way, culminating in the caution-inspiring crossing of Thunder Creek about one miles past the junction for the Rock Creek trail. A narrow log about six feet above the water is all that spans this rushing torrent, with no handrail or any other measure to prevent a slip into the creek. Cross here with extreme caution, then marvel as you continue on at the mountain bike tracks evident in the dirt on the other side of the creek! Mountain biking is permitted here on odd-numbered calendar days from June 1 to October 31 depending on the conditions of the trail, so don&#x2019;t be surprised if you see a cyclist coming your way. Maybe ask them how they negotiate that crossing with a bike.<br><br>From Thunder Creek, it&#x2019;s just about one more mile to Goldmyer. Hike through more forest, and finally come to a large meadow, with greenery up to six feet tall. Once through this meadow, arrive at a complicated structure crossing a large creek. This is Burntboot Creek, and the three logs that cross its wide span have been carefully placed so you can cross securely.<br><br>On the other side of Burntboot Creek, you are on Goldmyer Hot Springs property. Hikers are allowed as far as the entrance to the hot springs, where a billboard welcomes you and offers information about the resort, but without reservations, the hot spring are off-limits, so be sure to make those reservations before you undertake this 12-mile journey.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Please note that while dogs are allowed on the trail, dogs and pets are not allowed at Goldmyer. If you&apos;re hiking with your canine, consider making the bridge over Burntboot Creek your turnaround point, since it&apos;s only a few steps on the other side of the creek before you hit Goldmyer property.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Day-hikers and backpackers alike visit Lake Dorothy, a very large and beautiful lake less than two miles from the trailhead. Once there, they either rest and play for the day, or continue on to Bear and Deer Lakes, a pair of very pretty smaller lakes deeper in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. The very ambitious press on to remote Snoqualmie Lake. Lake Dorothy can be crowded on summer weekends, but the other lakes see fewer visitors. <br><br>Sign in at the trailhead and begin your hike. You&apos;ll find the trail to Lake Dorothy generally in good condition, with many sections stabilized by carefully-assembled log cribs. It&apos;s about 1.9 miles to the lake, with an 800 foot elevation gain. After the first mile, come to a crossing of Camp Robber Creek. Pause there on the sturdy bridge to appreciate the whitewater rapids, and to enjoy the welcome (in summer) breeze that often blows down the canyon. <br><br>Then continue on up the trail, encountering additional log cribs. When you reach the outlet of Lake Dorothy, a sign offers the choices of &quot;Outlet Spur&quot; straight ahead, or &quot;Inlet&quot; and &quot;Bear Lake&quot; to the left.<br><br>Whatever your plans are for the day, begin with the Outlet Spur. In about 100 yards it passes a log jam at the outlet of the lake. Some of the logs are quite large and have been firmly in place for many years. Look carefully and if you feel comfortable, walk carefully a few feet out onto the logs, as many others have done before you. The reward is the best view of Lake Dorothy you will find, looking up the entire 1.5 mile length of the lake with a view of Big Snow Mountain beyond. It&apos;s a great photo op, particularly if you arrive early in the morning while the sun still is fairly low in the eastern sky.<br><br>Then check the creek downstream of the log jam. The outflow is initially very tranquil, and sometimes a dipper bird may be seen foraging in the shallow water.<br><br>If you plan to go on to Bear Lake, or are seeking a campsite, or are just exploring farther along Lake Dorothy, return to the trail junction. In summer, there is often a posting showing the locations of many camp sites (and a few backcountry toilets) along the eastern and southern shores of the lake. <br><br>Take the trail toward the Inlet and Bear Lake, but don&apos;t expect it to be a lakeshore stroll. For much of the way the route is well above lake level. Occasional paths descend to reach campsites on benches above the lake or sites down at the lakeshore. The route alternates between forested and rocky stretches, and there is some up and down.<br><br>If you are hiking in August, be alert as you pass bushes along the trail. You are likely to find ripe blueberries edging the trail.<br><br>After hiking 1.8 miles from the outlet, come to Lake Dorothy&apos;s inlet stream. There is no bridge, but in summer the stream can generally be crossed on boulders, though trekking poles may be helpful for balance.<br><br>Near the southern end of Lake Dorothy, an occasional tall, dead tree offers a perch for ospreys that forage there for fish. Eagles may be seen too.<br><br>If your plans are for Bear Lake, get ready for some uphill. You&apos;ll gain 700 feet in 1.6 miles, on sometimes rough trail to reach the pass to Bear Lake. But the way is eased by occasional enjoyable views down to Lake Dorothy.<br><br>A short way beyond the pass Bear Lake can be seen glinting through the trees. But the trail takes its time getting you there. It&apos;s a half-mile with a drop of 200 feet to get down to the western shore of the lake. This is a nice place to sit a while, relax and have a snack. It&apos;s over 5.5 miles from the trailhead, so Bear Lake is the turn-around point for many day-hikers.<br><br>Deer Lake, a twin of Bear Lake, is not far away. It&apos;s only 30 feet lower than Bear Lake, and going there adds less than a mile to your round trip. At one point along the ongoing trail, bits of both lakes will be visible through the trees, so you can check out Deer Lake without going all the way there.<br><br>If you are backpacking, there are possible campsites along the western shores of Bear Lake and Deer Lake. Also, a path leaving the main trail between the two lakes heads toward a bench between them, and you could investigate that area for additional camping opportunities.<br><br> <br>Extending Your Hike<br><br>The trail continues on beyond Deer Lake toward Snoqualmie Lake, itself a large, beautiful and isolated lake in a forested setting. It&apos;s just over a mile from Deer Lake, but there is a downside - literally. Snoqualmie Lake is less than 100 feet higher than Lake Dorothy, and to visit it you have to descend about 500 feet, elevation you&apos;ll have to regain on your return. So check your time and assess your energy. If it seems feasible and your interest is high, go for it.<br><br>A short way beyond Deer Lake, cross a low ridge and soon you will see part of Snoqualmie Lake down below. The view is deceptive. The lake looks very close, but it will take longer than you imagine to work your way down the steep switchbacks and around to the north end, where the trail finally reaches lake level.<br><br>But, once you are there, enjoy the sandy beach and the great lunch rock that offers a commanding view down the lake. It&apos;s a place to relax, and to reflect that you are over seven miles from your trailhead. There is an optional southern approach to Snoqualmie Lake along the Taylor River, but that&apos;s an even more imposing hike of 8.3 miles.<br><br>If you are a backpacker, you can find a few campsites along the north end of Snoqualmie Lake. If you are visiting on a weekday you might have the lake all to yourself.</p>\n                 ",

The peninsula&apos;s wildest rainforest valleys are up the Queets River, and many a hiker has never ventured into this enchanting corner of Olympic National Park. The main deterrent is accessibility, both to and on the trail. The gravel 14-mile Queets River Road can often be agonizing to drive. And once you reach the trailhead, you&apos;ll find there&apos;s no bridge over the river! This keeps more than a handful of adventurers from ambling up the trail. But if you persist you&apos;re guaranteed a lonesome journey.<br><br>From the trailhead kiosk look down the steep riverbank to see what lies ahead: the Sams River rushing into the Queets. Both need to be forded if you&apos;re intent on exploring this wild valley. The crossing can be intimidating, but in the drier months of August and September the rivers are usually only knee-deep. A set of old running shoes and sturdy trekking poles should help get you across safely. Do not attempt to cross early in the season or after heavy periods of rain. Remember, too, that on hot days the water will be higher on your return due to the melting snow feeding the river. If it looks unfavorable, head over to the Sams River Trail instead.<br><br>Once you&apos;ve crossed the wide river, you&apos;ll get to experience a wilderness Olympic valley the way it should be experienced-crowds in absentia. Giant firs, towering spruce, and humongous hemlocks 200-plus feet tall and several hundred years old humble your stature and status. Moss-draped maples and lichen-blotched alders line the trail. Boughs of ferns 4 feet tall crowd the understory.<br><br>Although the Queets is in essence a wilderness, it has experienced man&apos;s presence for centuries. Native Americans long hunted this remote valley. A few hardy pioneers homesteaded it. At 1.6 miles a dilapidated barn is evidence of the latter&apos;s tenure.<br><br>From this small clearing, Kloochman Rock can also be seen peeking above the remote valley. At 2.3 miles a short side trail leads left 0.25 mile to one of the biggest and oldest Douglas-firs in the world. With a trunk 14 feet around, this tree began its life sometime around the first millennium.<br><br>Through lush bottomlands the Queets River Trail heads deeper into the heart of the Olympic Mountains.

A great hike for late spring, late fall, or lazy summer days, the upper Icicle invites outdoor adventurers of all levels.<br><br>In an impressive grove of towering cottonwoods, ancient western cedars, and gigantic Engelmann spruce, the wide and well-trodden path begins its upriver journey. Within five minutes (more if the big trees hold you captive), enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.

Traversing grove after grove of ancient giants and passing one gurgling creek after another, the way lethargically delves deeper into the wilderness.

But the flowered meadows, and tundra slopes, and precariously perched larches, and the awesome views of nearby lofty peaks . . . make it all worth it!<br><br>The trail starts off easy enough, winding gently through ponderosa pine groves on good tread. But after crossing Chatter Creek on a bridge at 1 mile (elev. 3000 ft), the grade stiffens, the tread deteriorates, and brush moves in (when was the last time this trail saw a pair of loppers?). Enter wilderness and begin to wildly climb.<br><br>At about 1.7 miles (elev. 4100 ft), catch a view south of the slide responsible for forcing Icicle Creek to jump its bed. Notice that it originated from an old clear-cut (draw your own conclusions). At 2 miles, just after skirting a talus slope, recross Chatter Creek, this time without aid of a bridge. Old fir forest soon yields to brushy willow, while the tread gets rockier.<br><br>A reprieve from climbing comes at 2.5 miles as the trail eases into a hanging valley (elev. 5000 ft). Forest cover gives way to rock gardens, with views limited to the great northern rocky face of Grindstone Mountain.<br><br>There&apos;s more tough going ahead as you start working your way over a head-wall where Chatter Creek cascades through heather meadows and over granite ledges. Push on to a small gap along the lofty ridge crest (elev. 6680 ft). Here, 4.5 miles from the trailhead, enjoy a breathtaking view of Cashmere Mountain to the south, Big Jim and Icicle Ridge to the east, and down the Index Valley to the north. And speaking of down, the trail now drops steeply 300 feet into a lonely basin of talus and larch. Snow lingers here well into July and may create a difficult descent and require some routefinding.<br><br>Skirt left of campsites and small tarns to traverse a jumbled pile of rocks. Good tread returns as the trail drops into a small basin of gurgling streams and lush meadows (elev. 6275 ft). Come to a post denoting a junction. Ignore the fading tread right, choosing instead the more obvious way left that heads up a gully alongside a cascading creek. Then cross the creek and head up a steep side slope, reaching a junction with the Icicle Ridge Trail at 5.75 miles.<br><br>Lake Edna lies 0.5 mile and 300 vertical feet up to the left. A carpet of wildflowers leads the way into the semibarren basin that houses the twinkling alpine lake. Cape Horn looms over the icy cold waters, a stunning backdrop. Tenacious flowers enhance the rocky and grassy shores, while a smattering of larches add a soft golden touch later in the season. Despite the rugged nature of this place, it is quite fragile. Explore with care, and if you care to spend the night, do so at least 200 feet from the shoreline.\n                 ",

Now begin to reap the scenic rewards that justify all this toil.<br><br>Along a ridge awash in yellow and purple blossoms and punctuated with ghostly silver snags, continue gaining elevation. Savor the alpine views along with the flowers. Cashmere Mountain lies directly east across Jack Creek. Snowgrass, Grindstone, and Icicle Ridge fill the northern sky.

Most hikers heading into the Enchantments use the Lake Stuart trailhead, but make for the Core zone via Colchuck Lake and Aasgard Pass.

Along the way, you&#x2019;ll pass through marshy land dotted with trillium well into summer, since the snow sticks around at this altitude for quite a while. One and a half miles in, a large, sturdy log bridge crosses Mountaineer Creek; an eight-day WTA backcountry response team worked here in 2014 to install the new bridge when the old one was beginning to show signs of decay. <br><br>Past the bridge, the trail begins to climb more steeply, through forest and large glacial erratics, boulders that are the last remnants of the ages when ice covered the landscape here. As you switchback through the forest, enjoy the sound of Mountaineer Creek crashing through the landscape, and see if you can spy Colchuck or Dragontail Peak through the trees. <br><br>Just over two miles from the trailhead, the trail flattens out as you arrive at a junction. Hikers occasionally make a wrong turn here, so be sure to take a look at the trees to your right. Signs indicate Colchuck Lake is reached via the trail to the left, and Lake Stuart lies down the trail to the right, rolling out ahead of you on an almost flat grade. <br><br>Lake Stuart lies 2 miles away, and includes some sections of moderate climbing, but for the most part, you&#x2019;ll enjoy a relatively flat stroll back into the valley that holds Lake Stuart. While much of your hike is through second-growth forest, a large meadow about a half mile from Lake Stuart offers expansive views of the valley at the foot of Mount Stuart. It&#x2019;s worth a short break for a photo, if nothing else. <br><br>Continue on to Lake Stuart, which may surprise you with its proximity to the trail when you finally do reach it. Several camping spots lie along the lakeshore, but because you&#x2019;re still in the Enchantments, you&#x2019;ll need a permit for overnight camping between June 15 and October 15. <br><br>If you&#x2019;re camping, be mindful of signs indicating Fragile Areas in need of restoration &#x2013; there&#x2019;s no camping permitted here. And if you&#x2019;re just here for the day, there are several day use areas with beachfront property for hot days. With its icy waters, the lake provides excellent relief from sweltering midsummer temperatures. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: In autumn, the larches here are gorgeous, lining the hillsides with golden light in the evenings.

While the final ascent to the lake is steep and rough in places, Colchuck&#x2019;s overall elevation gain of 2,300 feet makes its spectacular scenery accessible to hikers of almost any ability. In summer, cars fill not only the trailhead parking lot, but the road leading to it. As if Colchuck Lake alone weren&#x2019;t enough of a draw, it is one of the two gateways to the Enchantments, and the trailhead also accesses Stuart Lake, an easier and equally awesome destination. <br><br>Begin on the Stuart Lake Trail #1599. The first mile and a half climbs very gradually in forest, first dense and dark, then thinner and lighter, within earshot and sometimes sightline of Mountaineer Creek. Occasional breaks in the trees offer glimpses of the steep walls of the valley. <br><br>At the end of this first mile and a half, the trail crosses to the right bank of Mountaineer Creek on a sturdy log bridge. On hot days, standing at the midpoint of the bridge, hikers can catch some welcome relief from the breeze coming off the rushing whitewater of the creek. After the bridge, the route steepens and grows rockier, a small taste of what&#x2019;s to come over the hike&#x2019;s second half. <br><br>Three quarters of a mile later, the trail flattens out and drops a little before reaching a trail junction. Straight ahead the path to Stuart Lake rolls out, while the Colchuck Lake Trail #1599.1 breaks off to the left. Follow the trail to the left and after a short stretch in the trees, come to another log bridge that takes you across a narrow, turbulent section of Mountaineer Creek. The trail is a bit of a jumble as you hop boulders in a large talus slope along the creek&#x2019;s bank. A short distance later you near the creek again, but here its waters turn suddenly glassy smooth; a nice spot for a meditative pause before starting to climb once again. <br><br>At first, the trail switchbacks gently, but the closer it gets to the lake, the steeper and rockier it gets. At several spots along the way, views open up, first to the valley you&#x2019;ve just climbed out of, then up to the toothy ridge of Dragontail Peak. After one final steep stretch, the trail takes a jog to the right, drops into a small swale and suddenly, there you are at one of the finest lake views in the Cascades. <br><br>The trail seems to end at a broad granite face overlooking the lake. This is a great place to grab lunch and take in the scenery. Immediately across the lake is the imposing massif of Dragontail Peak. To the left of Dragontail is Aasgard Pass, the climb that serves as the unbelievably steep &#x201C;shortcut&#x201D; to the Enchantments. To the right are the remnants of the Colchuck Glacier and the slopes of Colchuck Peak, its true summit tucked out of view behind rocky towers. <br><br>The trail continues along the lakeshore another two thirds of a mile, at times rough and a little hard to follow. One of the least obvious route junctures is at a large tarn -&#x2013; it&#x2019;s a common mistake to follow the well-trodden dirt to the right, but the trail actually proceeds over rocky slopes to the left. After a series of bends and ups and downs in the trees, the trail reaches a rock field at the bottom of the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier. Here, subalpine firs give way to larches, and the formal trail gives way to a rock-hopping route that eventually heads up Aasgard Pass. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: There are campsites all along the lakeshore, but be aware that camping here is managed under the same strict regime as the core Enchantment Zone -&#x2013; overnight stays are by permit only from June 15th-October 15th.</p>\n                 ",

As far as miles per hour goes, Aasgard may be one of the slowest hikes you attempt. Achieving the pass is a thigh-burning, chest-bursting, eye-popping endeavor that offers as many extraordinary views as beads of sweat that will fall  from your brow as you ascend nearly 2000 feet in just three-quarters of a mile. <br><br>From Colchuck Lake, a trail has been tramped out by the hundreds of feet that head up and over Aasgard Pass each year. While it&#x2019;s relatively evident to those familiar with route-finding, this is not the trail for folks new to hiking, no matter your level of fitness. You&#x2019;ll need route-finding experience, agility, and excellent balance. Those lucky enough to score a permit for the Core Zone should consider these factors when you&#x2019;re thinking about heading in over Aasgard Pass for an overnight. While it may be considerably shorter mileage-wise, the trail up Aasgard can be treacherous if your center of balance is compromised by a pack loaded with overnight gear. <br><br>Rock-hopping around the head of Colchuck Lake gives way to a trail with a staircase-like grade. Further on, sections of scrambling are required to ultimately access the coveted Core Zone. The pass viewed from the lake is not the real top of the pass but instead a false summit, with even more elevation gain to be had before gaining the pass.<br><br>But once you&#x2019;re atop the pass, the striped rocks, gleaming snow, jagged peaks, and icy lakes that lie before you make it seem like you&#x2019;re in another world--even on another planet. The basin is so huge that other hikers seem like little ants below you at Isolation Lake, and sound is quickly absorbed into the air around you, giving the impression of solitude despite the fact that you&#x2019;re probably sharing the basin with at least a few other people. At 7800 feet, it seems like you&#x2019;re on top of the world, though Dragontail Peak rises above to the west and a large ridgeline looms overhead to the east. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Many people attempt the Enchantments as a one-day traverse, departing from the Lake Stuart trailhead and making the Snow Lakes trailhead their destination. If this is your goal, leave early! Hiking up Aasgard Pass is tiring, but doing so in the heat of the day (between 11am and 3pm) is even worse, and once you arrive at the pass, you still have 15 miles of trail to negotiate before arriving at Snow Lake trailhead. The sooner you can get Aasgard over with, the more time you&#x2019;ll have to enjoy your route out of this singular landscape.</p>\n                 ",

It&#x2019;s also attainable as a day hike, but you&#x2019;ll want to get an early start. Note that the round trip mileage given above is for a day hike form the Lake Stuart trailhead. <br><br>From Lake Stuart, follow the lakeshore trail and pass several campsites before delving into denser forest. A rough path is relatively easy to follow, though the many downed trees that cross the trail can be frustrating, and, when wet, slippery and dangerous. Take your time and watch your step here when it&#x2019;s raining or if the wood is wet. <br><br>The trail winds in and out of the forest for two miles, dipping into a marshy meadow at the head of the valley before ultimately heading back into the forest. You&#x2019;re looking for a tree with a horseshoe nailed to it roughly six feet from the ground. Keep a sharp eye out, since the horseshoe is as brown as much of the surrounding forest, and thus can be hard to spot. <br><br>But once you see it, the trail beyond is fairly evident. Taking off up the hillside, it&#x2019;s a no-nonsense route that climbs essentially straight up, keeping the outlet creek of Horseshoe Lake to your left for about half the climb. About a third of the way up, you&#x2019;ll cross the creek twice to keep the trail, and about halfway you&#x2019;ll cross it a final time. <br><br>Watch your footing the entire way up, as the trail is rooty, rocky, and sometimes so straight up that it&#x2019;s more like climbing a ladder than hiking uphill. Grus, or crumbled granite, can make for slippery conditions on trail, particularly where you&#x2019;re hiking on larger granite slabs. The final push to the lake is nearly vertical; a thigh burner going up and one that calls for extra caution descending. <br><br>At the lake, photo opportunities abound. Granite, larches, and the water full of glacial till make for stunning photographs. There are also plenty of observation points available--look down on Horseshoe Lake and Lake Stuart, from a craggy rock outcropping, or gaze across the valley to Mount Stuart and the other rocky massifs that form the head of the valley. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Snow lingers here for much of the year, so expect to run into some, whether on your way to the lake, or as you wander in the meadows around it. As always, be aware of Leave No Trace ethics, and tread carefully on exposed alpine meadows.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>In the Enchantments, nature has carved one of the magnificent places of this world--an alpine paradise of granite worn smooth by glaciers, larches manicured by wind and cold, and crystal blue lakes strung together by a creek that tumbles and thunders between them. Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don&#x2019;t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. <br><br>There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you&apos;re lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you&#x2019;re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. <br><br>This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. <br><br>Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The &#x201C;trail&#x201D; once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It&#x2019;s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you&#x2019;re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. <br><br>These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). <br><br>Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. <br><br>This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake. <br> <br>&#x201C;Perfection&#x201D; is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. <br><br>A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. <br><br>The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan&#x2019;s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun&#x2019;s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. <br><br>Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane&#x2019;s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. <br><br>Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you&#x2019;ll still feel as if you&#x2019;re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. <br><br>You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. <br><br>All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from June 15th to October 15th. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    One of the most heavily visited trails in summer, the Eightmile Trail is virtually ignored by winter recreationists. Cross-country skiers find the narrow trail and occasional steep pitches difficult to navigate while wearing their long boards, but today&apos;s snowshoes are tailor-made for tromping in and around tightly spaced trees and up steep slopes. In addition to peaceful solitude, this trail offers unmatched wilderness beauty. High alpine lakes appear in table-flat meadows covered by blankets of billowing white fluff. Crystalline creeks rush through icy channels alongside the trail. Above it all towers the monarch of the central Cascades--Mount Stuart. Joining that great bulk on the horizon are Cannon, Eightmile, and Cashmere Mountains. This trail can be more tiring than one might think, but don&apos;t fret if forced to turn back before reaching the upper end of the trail. There is plenty to see and enjoy on the lower half of this route to make even an abbreviated snowshoe trek here worthwhile. Bear in mind that this trail is at the bottom of a narrow valley in steep mountain country, so avalanche hazards are extreme. Knowledge of how to recognize and avoid avalanche dangers is essential for visitors on this trail.<br><br>The snowshoeing begins on the wide, moderately pitched FR 7601. This road contours along the hillside above Mountaineer Creek, gaining just 1300 feet in the 3 miles to the junction with Eightmile Creek. The lower valley is wide and scenic, providing plenty of pretty views south to Cannon Mountain and east to Icicle Ridge. At 3 miles, the road crosses Eightmile Creek. Instead of crossing the creek with the road, turn right and start up the narrow Eightmile Creek Trail, which weaves through the tight forest of pine and fir on the lower flanks of Cashmere Mountain.<br><br>The trail climbs gently for nearly a mile until, at 4 miles out, the route steepens as the valley narrows. At times, the trail is obscured completely, and routefinding skills are tested. But getting lost isn&apos;t much of a threat because the trail parallels the creek, so routefinding is merely an exercise in finding the most efficient path up the steep slopes. Fortunately, the steepest pitch is only a few hundred feet long. Then the trail returns to its moderate pitch. In fact, there is a mere 1100-foot gain from the point where the trail leaves the road to Little Eightmile Lake, encountered at 5.7 miles. Some potential campsites are found around this little pond, but much better sites can be found 0.5 mile farther up the valley--and another 200 feet higher in elevation--at Eightmile Lake.<br><br>This sprawling plain of ice and snow is in the shadow of Eightmile Mountain, which looms to the north, and you will find that a camp here is blessed with magnificent sunrises. Watching the morning sky brighten and seeing the icy face of Eightmile Mountain glow with dawn&apos;s orange light is an experience of a lifetime.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Backcountry<br>These routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses. These routes require complete competence in winter survival skills, avalanche and snow condition evaluation and some basic mountaineering skills.\n                 ",

And total vertical feet-oh boy, you&apos;ll gain plenty-so save it for a cool day when the serpents are sedate. Are you getting the picture? But the views are amazing: from the Chiwaukum to the Entiat to the Stuart ranges and beyond-savor the panorama on any day!<br><br>There&apos;s no easy way up Icicle Ridge. The Fourth of July Creek Trail provides one of the shorter routes, but though it reaches the ridge crest in a little more than a mile, it climbs nearly a vertical mile in the process. The switchbacks are relentless, and for most of the season so is the heat. Traversing south-facing slopes, the trail takes the full brunt of the east-side-of-the-Cascade-crest sun. But there&apos;s a bonus to that aspect. This trail often melts out by mid-May, providing early season high-country probing while surrounding trails remain buried in winter&apos;s white. In any season, though, take plenty of water along.<br><br>Start amid some big pines and firs. Cross Fourth of July Creek at 0.25 mile and start shooting for the stars. Through pine parklands and aspen groves, the fern- and bitterbrush-lined trail winds upward. Cross the creek once more and then begin to switchback like there&apos;s no tomorrow.<br><br>Up open slopes punctuated by massive ponderosa pines-climb! In early season marvel at the floral show spread out before you. In any season cherish the views expanding before you. At about 2 miles a spring (elev. 4700 ft) may be bubbling-but don&apos;t count on it. A little farther come upon one of the biggest ponderosas this side of the Black Hills. At about 3.5 miles the grade eases and the trail makes a long traverse before resuming its switchbacks.<br><br>At about 4.3 miles is another possibly flowing spring (elev. 5750 ft). Continue climbing through silver forest and rock gardens before making another long traverse. Across grassy slopes graced with whitebark pine, make one final slog, coming to the 6775-foot crest of Icicle Ridge and a trail junction at 5.7 miles.<br><br>Muster up what little energy you have left and head left on the Icicle Ridge Trail for 0.2 mile to a junction signed &quot;lookout site.&quot; Hang left once more and scramble 500 feet to within 10 feet of the 7029-foot former fire lookout site. The 1929-built lookout actually sat right on the rocky thumb. The steps and railings are now gone and so should be any desire to attain the true summit. Stay safe and enjoy the amazing panoramic views right before you. East it&apos;s Mission Ridge and the Entiat Range. North it&apos;s the Chelan Range, Glacier Peak, Poet Ridge, and the White Mountains. To the west, scan Icicle Ridge to Big Jim, Grindstone, and out to Daniel. And south it&apos;s the Stuart Range and that big mountain right in front of you, Cashmere. What a view! Worth every step.</p>\n                 ",

The trail was laid out by climbers-it&apos;s brutally steep and requires use of hands in one short section going over a headwall. It&apos;s not dangerous, but hikers skittish on ledges may want to opt for another trail. For those who work hard to get to this celestial setting, expect one of the most dramatic backdrops in the Olympics as your reward.<br><br>Named in honor of Carl Putvin, an early pioneer, trapper, and explorer, the Putvin Trail is as rugged and daring as its namesake. The first 1.4 miles, however, is relatively easygoing, traveling along tumbling Boulder Creek and crossing two narrow ravines before emerging on an old roadbed (elev. 2400 ft).

At 3500 feet enjoy a brief respite from climbing by traversing a brushy avalanche chute at the base of a large headwall.<br><br>As Whitehorse Creek plummets over the sheer wall in a series of breathtakingly beautiful cascades, the trail looks for a way to get over the wall. Angling to the northeast it ascends a series of ledges, some requiring handholds to thrust you upon the rim of the headwall. You made it! Now enjoy an alpine world flush in wildflower-bursting meadows and frog-fortified tarns high on a bench above the Hamma Hamma Valley. Enjoy views, too, of imposing Mount Pershing across the valley and Hood Canal and the Cascades in the distance.<br><br>At 3.2 miles enter Olympic National Park. Negotiate a crossing of Whitehorse Creek, and then make one final steep grunt over a snowfield and through thick greenery to the heavenly Lake of the Angels (elev. 4950 ft). Perched in an open basin scoured by ice and snow, the setting is spectacular. Cascading waters fed by perpetual snowfields stream down polished rock faces and over terraced ledges.

The Lower Lena Lake Trail doesn&apos;t offer panoramic vistas, but there is a pretty forest surrounding the route, with a nice creek basin to cross and the beautiful lake to enjoy. Beyond the lake, a short excursion to the Valley of Silent Men leads snowshoers into a cathedral-like forest of massive trees, flanking a clear, tumbling stream in a narrow valley. The ancient trees sport drooping beards of emerald green lichens and mosses, and the stream is lined with a lacy network of ice.<br><br>In heavy snow years, a thin layer of snow may be found at the trailhead (800 feet), but generally you will have to leave your &#x2018;shoes on your packs and start up the trail in your boots. The trail climbs steeply, though, and shortly after crossing Lena Creek at 1.5 miles, the snow deepens. When it is too deep, or too slick, to hike in boots, strap on the snowshoes and continue. <br><br>The trail tapers into a gentle climb at 1.6 miles and a quiet, serene forest surrounds the route. At 3 miles, the trail rolls along the west side of Lower Lena Lake (2050 feet). Follow the lakeshore north, and turn right to cross the first inlet stream at the north end of the lake. Head east along the second inlet, East Fork Lena Creek, as it climbs into the lush ancient forest of the Valley of Silent Men. Trail signs indicate this is the climbers&apos; route to The Brothers, but generally you won&apos;t be going that far. Snowshoe up the bottom of the valley, following the trail corridor as it weaves through the trees, for up to 1.5 miles from the lake before turning back.<br><br>The valley makes a great place to stop for a leisurely picnic. Sit and enjoy the quiet music of the stream tumbling over icy rocks. Listen to the songs of the birds flitting through the branches of the trees above: gray jays, as always, dominate the air when there is any chance they can beg--or steal--a meal from hikers. Relax in the soothing peace that covers all visitors to these cathedral forests, which are made all the more peaceful by the quiet of winter.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Backcountry<br>These routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses.

A dog owner looking for a place to walk with your furry friend? A parent hoping to introduce a child to the wonderful outdoors? Or maybe just a busy urban dweller searching for a quick escape from the hustle and bustle of city life? If you fit any of these descriptions, then look no further. Seward Park is the place for you!<br><br>Located southeast from downtown Seattle, Seward Park resides on the Bailey Peninsula in the neighborhood that shares its name. The city of Seattle bought the peninsula in 1911 and began developing the area into a park shortly thereafter. Since then, the park has become home to a variety of educational, recreational, and cultural activities. Visitors can enjoy a 2.4 mile bike and walking loop, an amphitheater, a native plant garden, an art studio, sheltered picnic areas, slightly more challenging hiking trails, a swimming beach, and more.<br><br>To start your urban adventure, begin at the Seward Park Environmental &amp; Audubon Center. Here you&#x2019;ll find restrooms, waste bags to clean up after your dog, an information kiosk with facts about the park&#x2019;s plant and animal life, and knowledgeable staff members who can help you make the most of your visit. Next, head southeast from the Audubon Center toward the children&#x2019;s playground to find the start of the outer bike and walking path that hugs the shoreline surrounding to park for 2.4 miles, labeled as trail #10 on the park map. <br><br>This trail is paved the entire way around and can be enjoyed by people of all fitness levels and abilities. As you begin walking along the path, take note of the poison oak signs. Stay on the path or trails to avoid an itchy encounter. You&#x2019;ll also notice lots of benches throughout the park to take a rest or to simply gaze out at beautiful Lake Washington. <br><br>At a little over half a mile you will come to a junction with another intersecting trail, trail #2. If you&#x2019;d like to cut the longer loop of the park short, make a left at this junction to cut across the park, otherwise continue straight. Shortly after this junction you will come across the site of the Seward Park Fish Hatchery built in 1935. Although the hatchery has been closed for some time, remnants of it can still be seen. Make sure to stop at the nearby information kiosk to read about its history.<br><br>Continuing on, you will come to another junction at approximately 1.75 miles. From here, you can leave the paved path and head into the interior of the park, where you will find slightly more rugged, wooded trails. These trails are ideal for those looking for a challenge and a detour from the more popular outer loop; however, be mindful of roots, logs and rocks that could present an obstacle for some. The interior dirt and gravel paths are all interconnecting and no more than a mile each.<br><br>After a side trip through the forest, return to the paved trail and continue heading west back toward the Seward Park Environmental &amp; Audubon Center. You&#x2019;ll encounter outstanding views of downtown Seattle, a friendly reminder that you barely have to leave the city to find an outdoor haven.  <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: After working up an appetite at the park, consider stopping for lunch at the nearby Flying Squirrel Pizza Co. which features locally made ingredients including meats from Zoe&apos;s Meats, Salumi Artisan Cured Meats, and Draper Farms, locally farmed vegetables, coffee from Stumptown Coffee Roasters, and ice cream from Snoqualmie Ice Cream. Flying Squirrel has been serving up delicious pizza to the community since 2008.</p>\n                 ",

Take the left trail-it&apos;s shorter and steeper, leaving the longer and more gradual option for the descent, relieving your knees.<br><br>The summit loop climbs 1,300 feet in just over 1 mile, through recently burned forest and remnant pockets of old-growth. At 2.9 miles from the trailhead reach the 4,301-foot forested summit. Don&apos;t despair, a small vertigo-inducing rock outcropping juts out of the forest providing a panoramic payoff. Directly below, waters sparkling, is Lake Cushman. Lightning Peak and Timber Mountain rise majestically behind it. Wonder Mountain and Church Peak are just off to the right. The Skokomish delta, Black and Willapa Hills, and Mount Rainier are all visible from this pulse-raising promontory. Through silver snags and white pines the deep valley of the North Fork Skokomish can also be glimpsed.<br><br>After your rosy outlook continue on the loop. Along a forested ledge, the trail makes a 1.7-mile saner return to the loop junction. Enjoy glimpses of Copper Mountain, but the real point of interest is a colonnade of four silver firs about halfway down the trail. They have grown so close together they appear fused. Now, test your trekking poles before careening down the mountain.</p>\n                 ",

More switchbacks and many with stairstep risers that add to the grade. The trail moderates briefly at the well-signed junction with the winter climbing route before heading up to the first of several panoramic viewpoints.  Stopping to admire the views at each of these is a great way to catch your breath. <br><br>The trail breaks out of the trees and rises onto rock-strewn slopes and across gravelly meadows before heading through a notch and continuing upward on the west facing slopes.

Never officially constructed, this trail resembles little more than a way path, especially the second half. We&apos;re talking <br><br>no-frills hiking here. Beginning at the end of the Hamma Hamma Road near a dramatic gorge and waterfall (did you peek over the bridge?), Mildred Lakes Trail no. 822 immediately enters the Mount Skokomish Wilderness.<br><br>Winding through recovering wilderness (the area was logged decades ago), the first mile or so is easy enough. But once you cross a large avalanche chute, the misery begins. Around fallen logs, over fallen logs, and straight-up rocky and rooty slopes the trail climbs a 3200-foot ridge. Mount Pershing looms in the southeast.<br><br>Through hemlock and huckleberry the trail hightails it off the ridge, dropping 250 feet into a cool forested glen graced by a rushing creek. Cross it on a questionable log (or wade), and within two minutes come to another creek crossing, this one much easier. Now the way gets tricky and even tougher. Ascending a steep ridge, upward mobility is temporarily halted upon coming to a ravine. Using roots as handholds, drop 25 feet into the dank draw before resuming the taxing climb. After clambering over rock, root, and ledge-and gaining 1000 feet in elevation-the insanity ends on a 4100-foot heather-draped ridge crest. Wander along the open ledge, enjoying excellent views of Mount Cruiser and the Sawtooth Range, but no lakes.<br><br>Your punishment isn&apos;t actually over. Drop 200 feet through marshy mosquito breeding grounds before finally coming to the first lake (elev. 3800 ft). Set in deep old timber with a backdrop of rugged summits, the scene is serene and it&apos;s all yours-you deserve it. Scramble over more root and rock to the far side of the lake for good fishing and resting posts. Share the abundant trout with the resident osprey.<br><br>If not totally spent, consider checking out the other two lakes.

What was once an ancient splash pool at the base of the falls is now a broad desert meadow dotted with lakes and ponds, swarming with birds and animals of all kinds, shapes, and sizes. This is a uniquely beautiful area to explore, both to delve into the geologic history of the area and to reach out and touch the native flora and fauna of the Washington desert.<br><br>Umatilla Rock towers like a giant fin in the middle of Grand Coulee in the basin below Dry Falls.

Along the North Fork Quinault River, you can embrace the pure wildness and raw beauty of the Olympic rain forest.<br><br>Like many trails following rivers deep into the Olympic interior, the first couple miles of the North Fork Quinault River Trail were once a road. Building roads up these narrow, wet valleys was difficult enough, but maintaining them proved to be even more challenging. Winter storms and spring floods have a way of wreaking havoc on them. Over the decades and faced with limited budgets, the Park Service allowed some of these disaster-prone roadbeds to be converted to trail-a plus for wilderness and solitude seekers, but a minus for hikers seeking easier access into the backcountry. The decision to convert, not always met with approval, occasionally induces rifts within the hiking community.<br><br>The North Fork Quinault&apos;s first 2.6 miles were converted long ago, making for an easy and enjoyable hike to a wide riverbank camping and picnicking spot known as Wolf Bar. Much of the way is right along the roaring river. And as in the past, the river continues to jump its bank, forcing reroutes and new tread to be built.<br><br>About 1 mile from the trailhead the first of several side creeks is crossed. While easy during summer, winter rains can make this and the other crossings difficult. At 1.5 miles traverse a huge gravel outwash area arranged with boughs of sword ferns and columns of maples swathed in moss. Next, cross a channel bed that may or may not be flowing. Traverse an alluvial island; then negotiate the channel once more. Now travel over more outwash, through groves of towering old growth and along newly exposed riverbanks.<br><br>At 2.6 miles arrive at Wolf Bar, a suitable destination for a shorter hike. Head out on the broad gravel bar for views of the surrounding steep-sided ridges adorned in swirling clouds. When the rain is in remission, worship the sun from this extensive outwash.<br><br>Beyond Wolf Bar the trail climbs a terrace, pulling away from the river. On an up-and-down course through thick forest, but always within earshot of the North Fork, the trail winds up the deep valley. At 5 miles, come to Wild Rose Creek, requiring a ford that may be dangerous during high water. The Halfway House site lies just beyond. Now a backcountry campsite, nothing remains of the old lodge.

And while chances are slim of running into other wayward souls, a chance encounter with an elk is possible. Through a deep canyon, Graves Creek booms and crashes on its way to the Quinault River, at times disappearing into a tight chasm. But the valley is never free from its thundering outbursts and explosives rants.<br><br>Start this hike on the popular Quinault River Trail to Pony Bridge and En-chanted Valley. Immediately cross Graves Creek on a sturdy bridge high above the churning waterway. In 0.25 mile come to a junction. Turn right onto the Graves Creek Trail, trading a well-worn pathway for narrow tread adorned with encroaching mosses.<br><br>Through a jungle of big trees draped in mosses and flanked with ferns, begin climbing out of the Quinault Valley. Numerous creeks flow across and, during heavy rain periods, down the trail. At 0.75 mile and after 400 feet of climbing, reach a bench high above Graves Creek. With caution, locate the waterway below as it tumbles through one of several box canyons lying along its route.<br><br>As you climb gradually, the valley walls grow steeper and Graves Creek&apos;s thundering roar intensifies. In late spring numerous cascades fall from the surrounding slopes, adding to the commotion. As you continue deeper into the valley, the trail dips close to the wild waterway at a few spots. Then it&apos;s more cascades, more rumbling, more climbing above the forbidding passages.<br><br>At 2.5 miles cross the first of two large avalanche chutes. Despite the low elevation (1700 feet) snow often lingers late into the spring. At 3 miles find a steep side trail heading down to a secluded pool on the creek. The main trail continues through big timber, traverses an open flat, and then at 3.5 miles descends to Success Creek. Here at the confluence of Success and Graves Creeks, two fords must be made if you wish to continue. Day hikers will want to call it quits here. Find a nice rock, pull out your lunch, and watch the dippers look for theirs.</p>\n                 ",

Come here in the heart of winter and find yourself among one of the largest elk herds in America.<br><br>The Quinault is one of the grandest of the rainforest rivers. Draining much of the Olympics&apos; southwest corner, the Quinault is comprised of two main branches: the North and East Forks. This hike takes you along a portion of the East Fork, through a deep glacially carved valley.<br><br>Start by crossing Graves Creek on a large log bridge. In 0.2 mile come to a well-signed junction. Continue left on a wide and well-graded trail, an old road that once extended almost to Pony Bridge. Along a bench, away from the river, traverse moisture-dripping groves of towering hemlock, spruce, and fir. In winter scads of hoofprints mar the surrounding saturated ground. Stay alert for elk. The trail meanders a little over a small rise. Scores of creeks and rivulets run under, over, and sometimes down the trail.<br><br>At 2 miles the old road ends. Pass an old picnic table rapidly losing a fight with the elements; then begin to drop a couple of hundred feet to the river. Finally, at 2.3 miles, the East Fork Quinault comes into view. Through a fern-ringed narrow canyon of slate and sandstone, the crystal-clear waters bubble and churn. Walk a little ways to Pony Bridge, which spans this scenic gorge.

Si Road--be sure not to block this turnaround if you&apos;re hiking this trail during the week! Also note that the tread consists of loose rock in places, so sturdy shoes or boots will help keep your ankles and feet happy on this hike. If you are hiking with children, keep them close by as there are some steep drop-offs along the trail. <br><br>Walk around the gate and follow the gently inclining Mount Teneriffe Road for approximately two miles, to an intersection signed for Teneriffe Falls. This is the start of the new trail to the falls. Turn right at this junction and begin climbing. For hikers familiar with the old bootleg trail that was painfully steep and dangerously slippery, the new switchbacked trail is a delight! If you&#x2019;re looking for a workout, don&#x2019;t worry, you&#x2019;ll still get it. Over the next mile, you&#x2019;ll gain most of the elevation on this hike, approximately 770 vertical feet. Thanks to the work of the Department of Natural Resources and the Mountains-to-Sound Greenway, the new trail makes the effort enjoyable.<br><br>The 22 switchbacks up to the base of the falls wind in and out of tree cover. Enjoy the second- and third-growth forest you&#x2019;re walking through and the sounds and sights of the nearby stream flowing from Teneriffe Falls. You might glimpse sections of the old bootleg trail that ran parallel to the stream along the way. Though it may be tempting to explore, please stick to the new trail! It was built to provide a safer route for hikers and to minimize erosion and sediment in the fish-bearing stream. <br><br>As you near the end of the trail, you&#x2019;ll get a view of the lower part of Teneriffe Falls. Snap a photo, and then continue up the last couple switchbacks to a viewpoint for the upper falls. You&#x2019;ll reach this point (unsigned) approximately three miles from the trailhead and 2370 feet in elevation. <br><br>Due to funding issues, this last section has not been brought up to standards. As a result, DNR does not consider the trail complete. The viewing area is a small, mostly flat area with a steep downhill drop-off, so be careful where you step and where you set your pack. If you choose to scramble down to the level area between the upper and lower falls, be aware of slippery rocks and sketchy hand and foot holds. Both make it difficult to get down and then back up to the trail safely. For groups of three people or fewer, this makes a nice snack or lunch spot. Larger groups should choose a spot down trail to take a break.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: If you&apos;re interested in extending your hike, it&apos;s possible to do so! Return to the junction with the road-to-trail conversion and continue heading up and up. After 2.25 miles of hiking, you&apos;ll come to a fork in the trail. The left branch is a trail that accesses the summit of Mount Si, just about 1 mile away. Alternatively, you can stick to the road-to-trail and in another 2.5 miles you&apos;ll arrive at the summit of Mount Teneriffe. Hiking all the way to the summit of Teneriffe makes for a 13.8 mile roundtrip hike.</p>\n                 ",

The hike eventually levels out to reward you with some respite from the calf-burning first quarter mile. Two opportunities to get on the Boulder Garden Loop will occur at 0.3 and 0.5 miles, both of which can tack on extra mileage to the trip or transition you to the Mount Si route if you so desire, but for the Little Si summit proceed left on the main trail until you reach a section of canopied forest that straddles the bluff. <br><br>As you continue through this temperate slice of woodlands, you will pass short tangential rock climbing paths, a prominent scree slope and a boulder field to the west before swooping around the slope at the 1.3 mile mark to make your final push toward the summit. Work your way up the last steep three quarters of a mile and you will reach your destination. While Little Si&#x2019;s nub-like qualities suggest an underwhelming view awaits, you will be pleasantly surprised to find a peak that supplies phenomenal portraits of the valley and the surrounding peaks-Mount Si and Mount Washington can easily be viewed on a clear day-from your standing elevation of 1,550 feet. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Very early on at 0.2 miles, make sure to duck off the trail to the southwest for a small ridge that provides a quick peek into the valley, a low elevation preview of what you can expect from the summit. If you&#x2019;re short on time or are not quite in the shape you thought you were when you started in the parking lot, it can function as a nice compromise for a picnic spot to watch the sunset on the valley. Also, once you feel you have mastered the Little Si trail, seek out other North Bend staples such as Rattlesnake Ridge, Mount Si and Mailbox Peak (all located within a five mile drive of the Little Si trailhead). Each provides varying levels of difficulty, trail diversity and magnificent views for prospective hikers.</p>\n                 ",

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. <br><br>To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. <br><br>Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they&#x2019;re ready to conquer the state&#x2019;s tallest peak. <br><br>Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. <br><br>Many hikers rush through this section, but it&#x2019;s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It&#x2019;s remarkable that they&#x2019;re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si &#x2013;- pioneering state legislator Frances North. <br><br>Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south &#x2013; look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it&apos;s not recommended to feed these animals. <br><br>The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though &#x2013;- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si&#x2019;s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats &#x2013; they&#x2019;re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. <br><br>It&#x2019;s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades. That is what makes this trail truly special.</p>\n                 ",

That old scenic high route later became the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT)--the brightest gem in the triple crown of the National Trail System (the PCT, Continental Divide Trail, and Appalachian Trail). While the PCT followed much of the old Cascade Crest route, this Rock Creek section was replaced when trail builders carved a new high route into the face of Kendall Peak.

From here, several destinations are at your disposal. HIkers can head downhill to access the Middle Fork River Trail or Goldmyer Hot Springs, where reservations are required. Or venture around the gate at the far end of the lot to hike along the Old Middle Fork Road to Dutch Miller Gap and beyond. <br><br>But with Hester Lake as your destination, opt for the trail marked for Dingford Creek. Begin climbing immediately after leaving the trailhead. The trail leads you steeply up the hillside as you pass moss-covered boulders -- glacial erratics from a time when this area was covered by ice. Watch your step here; rocks are underfoot as well as alongside the trail, and can create a tripping hazard. <br><br>As you hike through second-growth hemlocks, you&apos;re accompanied by birdsong and rushing water from Dingford Creek to your right. About a mile in you&apos;ll pass the adorably named Pumpkinseed Falls fed by Pumpkinseed Lake high above. Take a moment to appreciate the water that glides down a 25-foot granite face into a tiny pool before running off as Pumpkinseed Creek to feed the river below. In summer, the pool provides an excellent spot to splash your face before continuing on. <br><br>After the falls the trail levels off and traverses through meadows full of vegetation including Devils Club, and more pleasantly, salmonberry. Expect to make several stream crossings that can be a bit tricky in high water before finally getting to a fork at three miles in.<br><br>At the fork, head to the right to access Hester Lake. Despite the initial downward slope, the trail to Hester Lake climbs 1000 feet in two and a half miles, stopping suddenly at the large lake. Pull out that fishing pole -- there are plenty of trout in this lake. <br><br>If fishing isn&apos;t on your agenda, grab your camera. Mount Price looms ahead of you, its craggy summit soaring to 5587 feet, and offers excellent photo ops in evening or late afternoon light. Spend some time relaxing here before heading back the way you came.</p>\n                 ",

The Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road benefited from these efforts, which constructed the CCC Road, a 13.5 mile long route that parallels (roughly) the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road. The Lower Section can be tricky to navigate, as it borders private property, and signage here can send mixed messages. The trail itself is on DNR land, but be sure to bring an up-to-date map to verify your location as you hike.<br><br>The upper section of the CCC Road is just adjacent to the Middle Fork Road. Hiking this way, you&apos;ll avoid the somewhat confusing lower section, where DNR and private property bump up against each other. Here the trail is on National Forest land, so you&apos;ll need a Northwest Forest Pass, but the 3.4 miles to the Middle Fork Campground pass through uninterrupted quiet forest, creeks, and lovely views of the nearby peaks.<br><br>After departing from the trailhead, which is just off the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road, hike for 0.5 miles, taking the left fork when you come upon your first junction. Soon, arrive at a stream. This waterway can run very high in the spring months, making it dangerous to hikers. Consider saving this hike for late summer, when the water is lower and the way safer. If the water is low, cross the stream safely and continue your hike, heading gradually uphill. <br><br>A mile later, the trees open up, offering unbroken views across the Middle Fork Valley. Look for the Pratt River leading away up a drainage across the valley. This vista continues for about half a mile, so enjoy the varying angles of the area. <br><br>Fortunately, just as you reach the end of the views, you&apos;ll be distracted by a mossy rock face looming over the trail. This is a great spot to stop and enjoy the shade. Here you can either turn around and head back to the trailhead, making it a four mile roundtrip hike, or carry on to the Middle Fork Campground through the second-growth forest, with occasional views of the valley to your right.</p>\n                 ",

This is the Rainy Lake trail, which hugs the west side of Rainy Creek for the entire length of the trail. <br><br>Depending on the time of year, crossing Rainy Creek may be difficult, but once across, the trail is lovely. Follow the narrow, sometimes very faint boot path through lush forest and mossy undergrowth. Rainy Creek is your constant companion as you follow it ever upward toward the lake. The path alternates between brutal inclines and occasional plateaus, over a few blowdowns and straight up talus fields. The occasional views of Mount Garfield are excellent and the faint trail lends a pleasant feeling of seclusion.Near your destination, climb a little higher than the lake to cross over a rounded ridge and then descends to the outlet stream.<br><br>Rainy Lake lies beneath the exposed rock face of Preacher Mountain. It&apos;s not been officially maintained for years, except for the occasional &quot;trail angel&quot;, so it does not make for an easy or quick side trip, but it&apos;s a worthwhile endeavor for those seeking a more solitary adventure or a challenging hike.

Pass a couple of dispersed camping sites and come to a junction with the Quartz Creek trail branching off to the left at about 0.5 miles. Take the right fork, staying on a relatively flat, rocky trail that heads through quiet forest. Gaze at moss-laden birches, western redcedars, and western hemlocks towering over you.

After crossing this drainage, it&#x2019;s only about 0.3 miles to the turn off for Otter Falls. <br>The turn is typically marked by a large cairn.

Otter Falls is visible through the trees, but the best view doesn&#x2019;t come until you take a short path down to a small beach, where the imposing falls stream down a huge granite face. Though the water falls 1,200 feet, hikers who make it here can only see about 500 feet of falling water.

The park was founded in 1937 by Seattle Park Board member Archie Phelps, Judge William Long, Ben Evans of the Seattle Park Department, and Scout leader Clark Schurman, who was an expert mountaineer and wilderness camp developer. The park and its well-known centerpiece, Schurman Rock, were built by the Works Progress Administration from 1937 to 1941.<br><br>Camp Long contains old growth forest, including alder, birch, maple, Douglas fir, sitka spruce, and cedar. Several trails criscross this forest, including the Animal Tracks Nature Trail (0.34 miles), the Ridge Trail (0.11 miles), the Middle Loop Trail (0.45 miles), and the Lower Loop Trail (0.53 miles). There is a 0.1-mile spur trail, leading to Longfellow Creek, that exits the main area of the park at the Northeast corner. Maximum elevation change, from the parking lot to Longfellow Creek, is about 240 feet. In addition to hiking, the park offers birdwatching, rock climbing, camping, orienteering, and an environmental learning center.

Of course there are views of the Olympics too, and on the way down you&apos;ll get a pretty darn good look at them. This is a working forest, but most of the way is shaded by a cool canopy of evergreens.<br><br>Along with neighboring Gold Mountain, Green Mountain makes up the rooftop of the Kitsap Peninsula. Granted, at a grand ol&apos; elevation of 1639 feet it isn&apos;t exactly nosebleed-inducing. But Green offers enough relief above the surrounding low country-and sits right in the middle of the peninsula-to offer an eagle&apos;s-eye view of a lot of saltwater and snowcapped mountains.<br><br>The good news is that Green Mountain is accessed by several well-maintained trails and is surrounded by over 6000 acres of state forest. The bad news is that the trails are open to motorcycles. Now, I don&apos;t want to deny these users their rights to this piece of the public domain. I just would like to see a hiker&apos;s-only route here among the miles of motorized trails. Being in Bremerton&apos;s backyard and as one of the largest tracts of undeveloped land on the Kitsap Peninsula, Green Mountain is far more valuable than as a simple speedway for the throttle-inclined. Meanwhile, come here on a weekday for exhaust-free wandering. Let your mind wander too. Could Green someday become Bremerton&apos;s Tiger Mountain?<br><br>On the Gold Creek Trail, begin your hike in a recently cut area. Forested Green Mountain looms in front of you. In 0.4 mile enter cool forest along chattering Gold Creek. A few minutes later, cross the creek on a good bridge, then turn left at a junction. Shortly after, encounter another junction-on the left is the Plummer Trail, your return route. Hang a right, staying on the Gold Creek Trail.<br><br>Through a leathery dark-green understory of salal, bearberry, madrona, and rhododendron (visit in mid-May for the floral show), begin climbing. At 1 mile the trail splits (not shown on map). Either way works-they meet again soon enough. Limited views of the Olympics tease through the trees. At 1.5 miles reach a junction. The left (signed for Green Mountain Camp) is your return route. Continue right and in 0.25 mile come to another junction. Take the trail right, signed &quot;Vista.&quot;Follow it past the summit parking lot (only open weekends in the summer), and in 0.4 mile reach the summit.<br><br>Find a few picnic tables and a rocky overlook. The once-sweeping vista of the Olympics is being crowded out by new growth. (Call in the loggers! It is a working forest.) Views eastward over Bremerton, Puget Sound, and out to the Cascades remain decent though. The real treat, however, is on the return.<br><br>Retrace your steps 0.65 mile to the junction signed for Green Mountain Camp. This is the Beaver Pond Trail. Follow it for about 0.5 mile, dropping a few hundred feet to the junction with the Plummer Trail. The Beaver Pond (more a grassland than wetland) is to the right, about 0.25 mile farther. Take the Plummer Trail left to return. Built by the Backcountry Horsemen, it&apos;s the best hiking trail on Green Mountain.<br><br>After 0.5 mile you&apos;ll skirt a recent clear-cut. The view here of Lake Tahuya and the eastern Olympic front is absolutely awesome. Savor it-then continue another 0.5 mile back to the Gold Creek Trail. From this familiar junction it&apos;s 0.5 mile back to your vehicle.\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>The Snow Lakes trail is known mostly as the long, gradual way into the Enchantments; but it is a worthwhile - if deceptively grueling - destination in its own right. The narrow isthmus between the lakes offers a majestic view across the water to the towering heights of McClellan Peak. <br><br>Camping at Snow Lakes or nearby Nada Lake used to be the strategy of backpackers who missed out on the Enchantment Lakes lottery but still wanted to get within easy day-hiking range of the permit zone. However, the permit zone has since been extended to include nearly the entire Snow Lakes trail from the top of the first set of switchbacks all the way around the far shore of the upper lake. As in the core Enchantment Zone, overnight stays within this area are allowed by special-issue permit only from June 15th-October 15th. <br><br>From its beginning just off of Icicle Creek Road, the trail immediately drops a short ways to a wide bridge over the creek and then begins climbing, gaining 800 feet in a set of lengthy switchbacks over its first mile. The grade levels off somewhat for the next mile and a half as you head straight back into the Snow Creek drainage, passing through terrain still bearing the sooty scars of a forest fire long ago. This early stretch of trail sees quite a bit of traffic from rock climbers making their way to Snow Creek Wall, the vertical face of granite visible on the far side of Snow Creek. <br><br>You soon enter forest and skirt the edges of the creek before the climbing begins in earnest again. Another set of switchbacks takes you through an area of trees snapped off impressively by slides and wind &#x2013; you&#x2019;ll pass several trees that bear sobering gashes from crashing boulders. After crossing a log bridge over Snow Creek, things once again level out, climbing slowly, but steadily until a steeper section over talus slopes takes you to Nada Lake under increasingly striking granite peaks. <br><br>It is not uncommon to see mountain goats as you make your way around the lake over a flat half mile and beyond. Here, the trail once again steepens as it passes through another rock field. Fortunately, the remaining distance has greatly shrunk by this point, and before you know it, you are at Snow Lakes. <br><br>The trail leads across a masonry spillway at the midpoint between the two lakes which, rugged and beautiful though they may be, are manmade. They are part of the Icicle Irrigation District, as is Colchuck Lake on the far side of the Enchantments. The water is drawn down in late summer not only to help farmers in the valleys below, but also to send much needed cold water to rearing salmon at the Leavenworth National Fish Hatchery. Hike through at the right time, and you may witness a huge plume of water shooting out over the rocks above Nada Lake from a massive tunnel bored to Snow Lake straight through the rock. <br><br>Depending on the season, the spillway may be dry or may be underwater. When the water is ankle high, hikers often remove their boots and socks and walk across barefoot to a small peninsula that juts out into the water, providing views up and down the lake. <br><br>In one direction is an impressive collection of bleached snags that have drifted down the lake and mounded up in impossibly large numbers. The upper end of the lake soars. Over the far shore, smooth slabs of granite curve gracefully towards the water&#x2019;s edge while McClellan Peak towers above. <br><br>The trail continues from here around the lake and up into the Enchantments, but for day-hikers, this is the perfect spot to take in the views and turn around. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip #1: The hardest part of the Snow Lakes Trail is not the climb in, but the journey out. On the return to the trailhead, the trail sheds 3,600 feet of elevation over a rocky, uneven 5.3 miles between the outlet of Nada Lake and the bridge to the parking lot. Though seemingly not that steep, the uncommonly long downhill produces a constant jarring and pounding that reduces even hardened mountaineers to a pained shuffle by the time the parking lot comes into view &#x2013; unfortunately, with 24 switchbacks still left to go. Leave yourself time to take breaks &#x2013; no matter how used you are to long hikes, your feet will thank you. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip #2: For those camping, there are numerous spots around both Nada and Snow Lakes and along the trail. Pay attention to posted signs, though, as there are many places that are marked off-limits, such as those for day use only and those closed for restoration. There are lots of excellent spots tucked in the trees around Lower Snow Lake &#x2013; a sign points off the main trail just before the spillway. There are also a few scattered sites along the early portion of the trail, at 2.5, 3.3, and 4.75 miles from the trailhead. The last one is situated just before a sign prohibiting campfires beyond that point. However, the scarred landscape below argues for relying on a camp stove even here. Remember that camping is by permit only at all of these sites from June 15th through October 15th. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip #3: In late summer, pack insect repellant. By July, the Snow Lakes are home to a large and particularly voracious population of mosquitoes, especially in the dark, cool forest along its southeastern shore.</p>\n                 ",

In summer, appreciate areas of exuberant moss and greenery. And, with luck, you might have the trail all to yourself.<br><br>The Hidden Forest Trail is one of Tiger Mountain&apos;s more remote, internal trails so it offers no trailheads you can drive to. The lower end is along the West Side Road (Road 1000) and the upper end is along the Main Tiger Mountain Road (Road 4000.) These roads generally are gated, open to motor vehicle use only by technicians servicing electronic gear, or by occasional authorized shuttle vans transporting paragliders to the Poo Poo Point launch areas. So your hike on the Hidden Forest Trail needs to be part of a longer loop. One option, perhaps the shortest, is described here. For other possibilities, consult the Green Trails Map for the area.<br>  <br>As with any loop, your hike could be done in either direction. But the Hidden Forest Trail is just over one mile in length with an elevation gain of 960 feet, so it has some very steep sections. Accordingly, you might enjoy this segment of your loop hike more if it is done from north to south, when it&apos;s mostly downhill. Also, the views may seem better when hiking in that direction. By whatever route, your loop hike will involve some elevation changes that are significant.<br><br>Begin your hike at the paraglider landing field along Issaquah-Hobart Road. Be alert for any paragliders that might be coasting in quietly to land, then walk across the field to the signed beginning of the Chirico Trail to Poo Poo Point. (The odd name is a reference to the sounds of loggers&apos; steam whistles heard here over a century ago.)<br>  <br>Appreciate the picturesque quality of the lower part of the Chirico Trail as it traverses steeply across a hillside on stone steps. Then continue on, with a few switchbacks, to reach the grassy top of Poo Poo Point&apos;s South Launch Area. Pause here to catch your breath since you have come up 1,500 feet from the trailhead, and appreciate the view of Mount Rainier to the south, clouds permitting.<br><br>To the right of an old signboard, note a forest road turn-around. That road will provide the return route for your loop hike. For now, continue on the trail to the left of the signboard to reach Poo Poo Point&apos;s North Launch Area. Pause there to enjoy the views to the northwest that may include the Olympics and Mount Baker, again if clouds permit. If your timing is right you may see a few paragliders launching into the sky.<br><br>To continue, hike past the pit toilet and locate the signed Poo Poo Point Trail that arrives here from the vicinity of Issaquah High School. Continue on that trail about a half-mile, first dropping a little then climbing about 200 feet to reach a former railroad grade and a signed  trail junction. At the junction, take a right turn onto the One View Trail.<br><br>The One View Trail climbs about 300 feet before dropping into lonely Fifteen Mile Gap (a drainage boundary between Fifteen Mile Creek and Gleason Creek.) Beyond the gap, climb a few feet more and reach the main Tiger Mountain Trail, the TMT.<br><br>Turn right on the TMT and follow it just 0.1 mile to reach Larry&apos;s Crossing where you&apos;ll encounter the Hidden Forest Trail. Here, you have a choice. To your left, the Hidden Forest Trail climbs an additional 150 feet and, in about a quarter mile, reaches its upper end at Road 4000. If your ambition is to experience the entire Hidden Forest Trail you will need to hike this short upper segment first, then turn around and return to the TMT before descending the longer, lower segment to reach Road 1000. <br><br>If you opt to include the upper part of the Hidden Forest Trail in your hike, go for it. The sign along the TMT indicates it&apos;s 0.3 miles up to Road 4000. But, when you get to Road 4000, note the sign there claims it&apos;s only 0.2 miles back to the TMT. This is not really a contradiction. Hikers know that distances often are shorter when hiking downhill! <br><br>While the Hidden Forest Trail does end at Road 4000 the route actually continues on, but with a different name. Across the road it becomes the Poo Top Trail and leads another 0.7 miles, with 600 feet additional elevation gain, to reach the West Tiger 1 summit. That&apos;s a possible extension for your hike, if your time and enthusiasm allow. Otherwise, turn around at Road 4000, descend past the TMT and continue down the Hidden Forest Trail.<br><br>About 0.2 miles below the TMT note a junction with an obvious but unsigned trail on your left. It&apos;s the Fifteen Mile RR Grade that rejoins the TMT 1.5 miles east, near Custer&apos;s Bridge. You might consult your map and keep that little-used, sometimes-overgrown trail in mind for a future exploratory hike.<br><br>If you are hiking in winter you may catch occasional glimpses of Mount Rainier though the trees, but once trees leaf out in the spring those views will disappear.<br><br>The forest here on the south side of West Tiger Mountain initially is more open than you may have seen elsewhere in the Tigers. And, because the Hidden Forest Trail descends nearly 1,000 feet, there is considerable variation along the way. In winter, some of the leafless deciduous trees have a ghostly quality. As you continue on downward you will encounter a few trees with very mossy trunks. In summer, when all the plants in the understory are leafed out, the growth can be very exuberant.<br><br>Lower down on the trail, as you approach Road 1000, the trees become larger and conifers begin to dominate. You will reach the road rather abruptly, next to a small seasonal stream. <br><br>To begin your return, hike the graveled Road 1000 west 1.25 miles, gaining about 400 feet before the road levels out. You are unlikely to see many vehicles, perhaps none at all, but mountain bikers are a definite possibility.<br><br>Come to an obvious fork in the road where both branches are graveled and show signs of regular use. These lead to the two launch areas at Poo Poo Point. Unless you want to revisit the North Launch Area, take the left fork and soon you will arrive back at the familiar South Launch Area. From there, descend the Chirico Trail back to your trailhead.</p>\n                 ",

The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging. More recently, around the 1970s, the area around Poo Poo Point was logged by its then owners, Weyerhaeuser Corporation. The result is a large clear area used now as a launching pad by paragliders who generally backpack their lightweight gear up the Chirico Trail, or sometimes arrive by minibus.<br><br>From the parking lot, take the obvious trail across the landing field. Be alert for any paragliders who might be coasting in quietly to land. At the eastern edge of the field enter Tiger Mountain State Forest and find yourself on the Chirico Trail.<br><br>The first part of the trail, with its steep, forested hillside and many stone steps is very picturesque. If it strikes you as akin to stepping into a classical Chinese landscape painting, you are not alone. Appreciate the magic. This steep face of Poo Poo Point is known as the Yah-er Wall. As you continue a steep traverse across the Wall the trees become smaller and more spaced out, and the hillside-but not the trail-becomes less steep.<br><br>Farther along, impatient hikers have, over the years, cut some of the corners. To minimize erosion please try to follow the official trail.<br><br>Continue hiking in regenerated forest and, at about 1.6 miles, come to the South Launch Viewpoint. This  open area sometimes is used by paragliders, and it is a good place for a short break while you enjoy the unobstructed view of Mount Rainier, clouds permitting.<br><br>Then continue on another quarter mile, gaining 140 feet, and reach Poo Poo Point and its North Launch Viewpoint.<br><br>The gravel road you see arriving at the Point is the West Side Road, one of several non-public service roads that begin at the Tiger Summit on Highway 18.<br><br>The Point is a great spot to sit, have a snack and enjoy the view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue&apos;s downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle&apos;s tallest buildings showing beyond. On a clear day, more distant mountains may be visible. If your timing is right you can enjoy watching paragliders launch from the steep northwestern face into the sky .<br><br>There are two picnic tables at the Point, and there is a Clivus toilet.

But if you can accept that wilderness includes lands returned to a state of wildness, you&apos;ll love this simple little Cougar Mountain hike in a natural wonderland that&apos;s just minutes from an urban jungle. Though the trail is usually hikeable year-round (snowfall is scarce at this elevation), the route is best enjoyed in the fall through spring because mosquitoes buzz here in great numbers during the summer.<br><br>The Wilderness Creek Trail crosses a sturdy, picturesque bridge over the pretty creek before climbing immediately up a series of switchbacks to lead you up and out of the creek canyon. The creek itself can be seen frequently from the trail as it tumbles down the steep draw, rushing over rocks and dropping over small falls. At around 0.5 mile you&apos;ll reach a trail fork.<br><br>To the right is the path you&apos;ll return on. For now, go left and you&apos;ll soon recross the creek and continue up the creek valley. Here, the forest boasts stands of maple, cottonwood, alder, and fir. This mixed forest allows great light penetration to the forest floor, which makes the moisture-rich creek valley an emerald basin of mosses and ferns that seem to cover every surface. From huge boulders to old, rotting logs, greenery grows everywhere. This rich world of green can be a wonderful place to escape the heat of summer. But for our purposes it&apos;s simply a grand landscape to enjoy while hiking on to greater adventures.<br><br>Continue up the trail as it veers up the lower slopes of nearby Ring Road Peak (not-so-creatively named for the old road that circled &apos;round the peak to its top). At the next trail junction stay right to recross the creek again, and then move onto a long section of boardwalk trail that keeps you above the murk on Big Bottom Bog. The forest here is largely very old second growth and even some native deciduous stands.<br><br>After crossing the boggy bottomlands at the upper end of the creek valley, the trail starts up the flank of Wilderness Peak. You&apos;ll find yourself among majestic old Douglas-firs in a forest largely untouched by man--only a few old stumps reveal the hand of hard-working independent loggers (gypos) who harvested single trees. Look closely and you&apos;ll see the notches cut for the sawyers&apos; springboards--long planks stuck into the axe-hewn notches so the loggers could stand and saw through the tree trunk above the wide spread at root level.<br><br>After hiking just 1.3 miles you&apos;ll cross Sky Bear Pass at 1320 feet, and in another 0.25 mile find yourself at Far Country Lookout. At the junction here, go right to ascend to the summit of forest-crowned Wilderness Peak. You&apos;ll find scant views other than of the forest around you. Continue on down the far side of the peak to Big View Cliff on the southern slope before reaching that original trail split at the top of the first set of switchbacks you encountered on your trek out.\n                 ",

With multi-use trails and a natural area, hikers have plenty to explore in this quiet sanctuary outside of Issaquah. <br><br>Created in 1972 when the Bulitt family donated 590 acres of land at the top of a mountain near Issaquah to the state. The donation included a stipulation that the land must remain in its natural state. Several other parcels of land were acquired over the years, combining to make Squak Mountain the extensive network of trails it is today. <br><br>Traces of early land users are readily found throughout the park, from remnants of old coal mining rail trails to overgrown logging roads. Massive old-growth stumps dot the forest alongside the trails. The Bullitt fireplace, a popular park destination, is all that remains at the site of the Bullitt&apos;s summer home.<br><br>The most direct route to the summit is to follow the signage for the Central Peak trail, a 3.3-mile distance. In general, proceed towards the higher elevation for the shortest route. There are many side trails that can be taken to add loops and additional viewpoints. Once you reach the Bullitt Fireplace, the summit is only a short distance away. The lower parts of the trail are multi-use; the last 1.6 miles are hiker-only.<br><br>The park features a self-guided interpretive walk along the .3-mile Pretzel Tree Trail adjacent to the main trailhead.

The knoll is only a few feet higher than the surrounding area, but it qualifies Poo Poo Point - if minimally - as one of West Tiger&apos;s summits. <br><br>The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging. More recently (1970s) the area around Poo Poo Point was logged by its then owners, Weyerhaeuser Corporation. They even took the stumps! The result is a large clear area used now as a launching pad by paragliders who generally backpack their lightweight gear up the Chirico Trail, or sometimes arrive by minibus. The Point also offers a fine view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue&apos;s downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle&apos;s tallest buildings showing beyond.<br><br>From the trailhead on Second Ave SE in Issaquah take the unsigned trail, passing swampy areas and the high school athletic fields. In 0.3 miles come to the first trail sign, placed there by the Issaquah Alps Trail Club to mark the start of the High School Trail. Turn right at the sign and, in 100 feet or so, bear right again, heading uphill on an old road grade. A later sign indicates passage from the Issaquah city limits into Tiger Mountain State Forest. Another sign mentions wildlife, and displays prominent images of a bear and a cougar. They are out there, of course, but the likelihood of a sighting is very slight.<br><br>Continue on the old road bed, ignoring side trails whether signed or unsigned. At 0.8 miles cross a small creek that flows all year from Round Lake on the Tradition Plateau. At 0.9 miles come to a power line. A few feet to the left a wooden trail sign points to the right up a rocky slope, indicating the way to the Poo Poo Point and Section Line Trails. Hike that way, and very soon come to the signed beginning of the Poo Poo Point Trail. The fainter trail heading left though a wooden gate is the steep Section Line Trail that goes to West Tiger #3.<br><br>The Poo Poo Point Trail crosses the open route of a buried gas line, then climbs steadily up an old railroad grade through mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. In early spring, look for trillium, bleeding heart, and yellow violets. Later in the summer, be alert for salmonberries or thimble berries. Throughout the year, hikers can enjoy the vigorous growth of ferns and the accumulations of moss on trees.<br><br>The route traverses Many Creeks Valley crossing a number of small creeks, some of them seasonal, then levels out briefly to cross Gap Creek on a high bridge. This is a great place to pause and view the stream and many large mossy trees. The trail then continues on more steeply through coniferous forest. Note the many old decaying stumps, a remnant from logging days, some of them now appealing abstract sculptures in reddish brown tones.<br><br>Soon, reach a signed three-way trail junction and the highest elevation of your hike. To the left is the West Tiger Railroad Grade, straight ahead is the One View Trail. Head to the right, where the trail continues to Poo Poo Point, now just a half-mile away. <br><br>The trail loses 170 feet of elevation before resuming a very gentle climb on an old logging grade to reach Poo Poo Point - specifically, the North Launch Viewpoint. The gravel road seen arriving at the Point is the West Side Road, one of several non-public service roads that begin at the Tiger Summit on Highway 18.<br><br>The Point is a great spot to sit and enjoy the view and have a snack. There are two picnic tables, and there is a Clivus toilet. There is no regular water source at the Point. If your timing is right you may enjoy seeing a few paragliders soar off the steep northwestern face of the Point.</p>\n                 ",

For a loop, you can choose either one and take the other coming down. <br><br>If you keep going up the ridge, hike along to the next junction with Phil&apos;s Creek, at about half a mile. Stay right on what is now briefly part of Phil&apos;s Creek trail, and after a very short time (.1 mile or so) you will reach another junction with Phil&apos;s Creek to your right, and Summit Trail to your left. <br><br>To go straight up to the summit, take the left. This is a steep trail, but a lovely one. Come out onto paved road, the South Access Road, which is closed to the public for driving, but hikers often use it. Uphill and to your right a very short distance up the road is the Central Peak, as one hiker says, &quot;Well, it is certainly towerful&quot;. There are tiny peekaboo views between trees along the road and at the peak.<br><br>Stay to the left of the towers and the Central Peak Trail heads down and to the west through a gate meant to bar horses and bikes, on a fairly gentle grade. Almost immediately you come to a junction with the Old Griz Trail. You can make the small or medium size loops by taking this down to either the Phil&apos;s Creek Trail for the small loop, 8.5 mi roundtrip. Or take the East Side trail for the medium loop, a little over 9 mi round trip. <br><br>For a longer loop, about 10 miles round trip, continue down Central Peak, staying right at the junction with the Bullitt Fireplace Trail, then about a half mile to the next junction with the Fireplace trail as that bends to meet you. Turn right, then right again after .2 mi at the junction with the East Side Trail, which runs mostly level. Stay on this trail past the junction with Old Griz at about .8 miles, then take the left-most trail at the junction with the East Ridge trail after another mile. You can also make a loop by taking the Bullitt fireplace trail. Be sure and bring a map - all those junctions can be confusing!<br><br>In all cases, you will return the last 2.5 miles down the East Ridge and out the Access trail, passing the condos the same way you came in. If you park at the Sunrise Place by the Access Trail entrance, all mileage counts will be less by about 2 miles.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>If you are bored at the thought of yet another hike up West Tiger #3, here is an option for a more ambitious hike. First, the route will take you to Poo Poo Point, a knoll on a shoulder of West Tiger Mountain, for the view and perhaps to see paragliders launching into the sky. Then, you&apos;ll continue via a sequence of short trails to reach and traverse all three numbered summits of West Tiger Mountain before returning to your trailhead.<br><br>From the High Point trailhead on Tradition Plateau, follow the wide graveled trail 0.1 mile south. Pass the signed turnoff to the West Tiger #3 Trail and the Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT,) and follow the wide trail around to the right. In 100 yards cross a small bridge and, 100 feet beyond that, turn left onto the signed Nook Trail.<br><br>Follow the Nook Trail, at first gently uphill. The trees you pass here, heavily draped with moss, may seem to endow the forest with an ancient quality, but it&apos;s all regrowth. Here and there along your route, occasional remnants of huge stumps hint at the truly-ancient forest that once graced these slopes.<br><br>Your route gradually becomes steeper. At 0.7 miles, take a sharp right turn onto the signed Talus Rocks Trail and, in another 0.25 miles, come to the Section Line Trail. Perversely, the sign there shows only an arrow pointing to the right (downhill, toward the High School Trail.) Ignore that arrow! Take a sharp turn left, uphill, onto the Section Line Trail. In a few feet, pass a sign proclaiming &quot;Unmaintained Trail,&quot; which just means that maintenance is done by volunteer crews.<br><br>The first part of the Section Line Trail may not seem too steep, but that changes. Short sections of the trail are among the steepest in the Tigers. In 0.2 miles come to the first steep section. Beyond that, the grade eases just a bit then reaches another steep section passing around a rocky outcrop.<br><br>In summer, as you hike parts of the trail where little sunlight reaches the forest floor, look for saprophyte plants such as Indian pipe, coral root and candy stick.<br><br>Press on, and soon come to the West Tiger RR Grade. (The Section Line Trail continues on to the West Tiger #3 summit, and will provide your return route.) Turn right onto the RR Grade. Most of the grade is nearly level, so this is a chance to catch your breath. In the century since logging trains last puffed along the grade there have been some wash-outs and slides, so expect occasional downs and ups.<br><br>In 0.3 miles, come to an unsigned trail fork. Take the right fork (the trail heading uphill to the left is the Seattle View Trail that connects with the TMT.)<br><br>Over the next 1.3 miles, the West Tiger RR Grade traverses Many Creeks Valley, crossing a number of small creeks on bridges constructed in recent years. Some of the creeks are seasonal, others run all year. In summer, some parts of the trail may be overgrown. <br><br>Come to a three-way trail junction. From the downhill side, the Poo Poo Point Trail arrives from the direction of Issaquah High School. The trail continuing on uphill is the One View Trail, and that will be your route AFTER you have visited Poo Poo Point.<br><br>For now, continue on the level grade. It changes names, becoming the ongoing part of the Poo Poo Point Trail, and it will take you to the point in 0.5 miles. Soon, drop over 150 feet on switchbacks, then resume a gentle uphill climb to reach Poo Poo Point. (The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging.)<br><br>Poo Poo Point lies on a shoulder of West Tiger Mountain, and a small knoll there is topped by a mast with a windsock. The knoll is only a few feet higher than the surrounding area, but it qualifies Poo Poo Point - if minimally - as one of West Tiger Mountain&apos;s summits. <br><br>The point offers a great view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue&apos;s downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle&apos;s tallest buildings showing beyond. On a clear day, more distant mountains may be visible.<br><br>If your timing is right you can enjoy watching paragliders launch into the sky from the steep northwestern face of the point. You also may see hikers at the point who have arrived there via the Chirico Trail.<br><br>To continue, return to the three-way trail junction and turn right onto the One View Trail. It&apos;s mostly uphill, but with an occasional downhill section, including a significant drop into Fifteen Mile Gap (there, streams to your right flow into Fifteen Mile Creek and those to your left into Gleason Creek.) Beyond the Gap, a short climb brings you to a junction with the TMT.<br><br>Turn right on the TMT and, in 0.1 mile, come to the sign for Larry&apos;s Crossing. There, turn left onto the Hidden Forest Trail (Sorry, the most interesting part of the forest is downhill to your right, but that&apos;s a different hike.) Follow the Hidden Forest Trail uphill, at first climbing steeply then leveling out. After 0.2 miles from the TMT, cross the Main Tiger Mountain Road (Road 4000,) one of several non-public service roads in the Tigers. <br><br>Across the road, your trail continues with a new name. It becomes the Poo Top Trail, and follows a ridge leading toward West Tiger #1. As ridges often do, this one has some ups and downs, so accept that your route to West Tiger #1 will cross several false summits.<br><br>After hiking 0.7 miles beyond the road you do reach the West Tiger #1 summit. It&apos;s next to a tower at 2948 feet, and is the second highest point in the Tigers, after East Tiger Mountain (3004 feet.) It&apos;s the highest point on your hike today. But it&apos;s forested, so you have to go a bit farther for the view.<br><br>Drop a short distance down the north side of the ridge, on switchbacks, and reach the signed Preston / Bypass Trail. (Names change in the Tigers, and your map may show a different trail name.) Turn sharply left there and continue 0.1 mile through dark forest to reach the Hikers Hut Viewpoint. (The hut itself is a small domed metal structure that might serve as a rudimentary shelter in winter.) Emerge abruptly from the dark forest into the open air and bright sunlight (clouds permitting,) and take a seat on the bench facing Mount Rainier. A swath of the Olympics may be visible too, from Mt. Ellinor at the south end to Mt. Constance as far as you can see around to the north.<br><br>In season, look for lupine and tall white daisies and, occasionally, tiger lilies. As you sit, you are likely to see humming birds and large dragonflies, and are almost certain to be visited by two or three gray jays hoping to beg a lunch offering. It&apos;s a good stopping point, so stay a while and enjoy the view.<br><br>When you are ready to continue, hike down the service road, dropping 400 feet. Come to a gate adorned with crude metal lettering &quot;No Trespassing.&quot; That&apos;s just meant to discourage unauthorized vehicles, and hikers are welcome to proceed via a trail around the right end of the gate.<br><br>Continue on the service road, gaining 250 feet, to reach the West Tiger #2 summit. It you are seeking the highest accessible point, take the one minute side trip from the road up to the tower fence and the summit sign. There is not much of a view.<br><br>Then return to the road and take the signed trail 0.4 miles on to the West Tiger #3 summit, crossing the TMT along the way. There often is a small crowd at West Tiger #3, and folks of all abilities hike to that summit from the north side. A few may have struggled to get there, so it&apos;s probably politic not to reveal that it&apos;s your fourth summit of the day.<br><br>Now it&apos;s time to descend back to the lowlands. Take the wide trail that leaves the summit toward the northwest. As the trail begins to level out, about 200 feet from the summit, be alert for an unsigned trail heading downhill to your left. That&apos;s the upper end of the Section Line Trail. As confirmation, a few feet down the trail come to one of those signs announcing &quot;Unmaintained Trail.&quot;<br><br>The footing on the Section Line Trail is not too bad when the trail is slightly moist. But when the trail dries out in summer it becomes gritty, and the small pebbles tend to roll beneath your boots. So watch your step, particularly in the steeper places. Trekking poles are advisable here.<br><br>Cross over the intersection with the West Tiger RR Grade, completing your loop, and continue on down the Section Line Trail another 0.5 miles. Be alert for the sharp right turn onto the Talus Rocks Trail and, a quarter mile later, for the sharp left turn onto the Nook Trail. Failure to make these turns could take you well out of your way.<br><br>Once you are back on the Nook Trail, it&apos;s an easy descent to Tradition Plateau, where a right turn on that wide graveled trail will take you back to your trailhead.<br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: The four-summit hike can be done from the High Point Trailhead as described above. Alternatively, with minor variations, your hike can begin and end with the High School Trail, or with the Chirico Trail. Each option takes you to the same four summits in the same order, and includes the West Tiger RR Grade. Check the Green Trails Map 204S and, for additional details, refer to the hike descriptions for the Poo Poo Point hike, or the Poo Poo Point - Chirico Trail hike.<br><br>Directions via the High School Trail: Park south of Issaquah High School and take the High School Trail to the lower end of the Section Line Trail. Hike the Section Line Trail, passing the intersection with the Talus Rocks Trail, and continue on to the West Tiger RR Grade. Proceed as above. On your return from West Tiger #3, take the Section Line Trail all the way down to the High School Trail, and return to your trailhead.<br><br>Directions via the Chirico Trail: Park at the paraglider landing field next to Issaquah-Hobart Road and hike the Chirico Trail to Poo Poo Point. Take the Poo Poo Point trail to the three-way trail junction and turn right onto the One View Trail. Proceed as above. On your return from West Tiger #3, descend the Section Line Trail as far as the West Tiger RR Grade, turn left and follow the grade back to the three-way trail junction. Continue on to Poo Poo Point, and return to your trailhead via the Chirico Trail.</p>\n                 ",

You&apos;ll even find some outstanding views during this long, gentle hike. If you want to keep from swatting mosquitoes with every step, visit in fall through spring.<br><br>Tiger Mountain&apos;s rich stands of timber and its close proximity to the booming city of Seattle proved too enticing for lumber barons to ignore. Trucking in the early 1900s wasn&apos;t efficient--to haul big loads you needed steam, and that meant railroads. As a result, short-line railroads were laid all over the mountain. Most wound through long series of switchbacks--the log trains would run forward up the first leg and out onto a long spur at the corner of the switchback turn. A lineman would switch the track so the train could back off the spur and continue backward up the next leg onto another corner spur. And so on until the log trains were at the top of the mountain. They&apos;d then reverse the process to descend. Today, hikers enjoy those same switchbacks, though the rails are long gone and the remaining forest is mixed second and third growth, with a few remnant stands of old growth.<br><br>From the trailhead, head south on the Bus Trail as it swings around the east side of Tradition Lake. The trail pierces the second-growth forests of the lower flank of West Tiger. You&apos;ll cross under the high-tension powerlines and turn left onto the Section Line Trail, following the lines for more than 0.5 mile.<br><br>At 2.5 miles out, turn left onto the Poo Poo Point Trail, climbing steeply up the rocky slopes before climbing through the middle of Many Creeks Valley. At 5 miles out (elev. 1200 ft ), cross Gap Creek on a stout bridge. Enjoy the views of the creek as it tumbles over a series of steps.<br><br>Beyond Gap Creek, the trail ascends steeply through a rare stand of old-growth Douglas-fir before crossing the West Tiger Railroad Grade at 5.6 miles. Turn left onto this trail to continue the loop (the right fork leads to Poo Poo Point). Stay on West Tiger Railroad Grade as it sweeps around the head of Many Creeks Valley, crossing as many as eight seasonal streams (and a couple year-round creeks). Stick to the main trail at all intersections and trail forks--there are many side trails leading away on both sides of the West Tiger Railroad Grade.<br><br>At about 7 miles you&apos;ll cross the route&apos;s high point (2000 feet) on the ridge below West Tiger&apos;s summit.

The plethora of trails around the Tradition Lake plateau make for an array of loop options, this one being the longest of the short loops possible. You&apos;ll find yourself wandering deep green woods. You&apos;ll smell the rich foliage bursting from the damp earth of woodland swamps. You&apos;ll hear the song of countless birds. And you&apos;ll see a spectrum of native flora and fauna, all within a few moments&apos; walk of the busy interstate corridor.<br><br>This route makes use of several trails.

As the raven flies, Custer&apos;s Bridge is less than three miles from the trailhead. By the TMT it&apos;s nearly eight. So why hike this route? Along the way you hike through deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests on both the shady north side and drier south side of West Tiger; past areas where the decaying stumps from old logging are evident, through moist areas with small creeks and an abundance of ferns and shrubs, and other areas where the forest canopy is so dense that little grows in the understory. Look for, and appreciate, these differences as you do the hike.<br><br>In season, you may find many forest wildflowers. In early spring look for trillium, yellow violet, bleeding heart and coltsfoot; a bit later miner&apos;s lettuce, vanilla leaf, salmon berry and red currant; in late June or early July, goatsbeard, foamflower and thimble berry. Many others, less common, are out there. Perhaps take a few photos, then consult a wildflower guide when you get home.<br><br>As a tribute to volunteers who had major roles in building the trail in the 1970s, certain locales were dubbed with folksy names such as Anschell&apos;s Allee, Ruth&apos;s Cove, Pete&apos;s Pass, Hopping Bridge, etc. A few of these names - only a few - are shown on the Green Trails map. All, initially, were identified by rustic signs posted along the TMT. Also, small markers were installed each mile to indicate the distance from the south end. Sadly, in recent years many of these signs and markers have disappeared, their fate unknown. Look for a few remaining ones on your hike.<br><br>From the parking area, follow the signs and hike the wide gravel trail 0.1 mile south. At the signed fork, turn left toward the W. Tiger #3 Trail and the Tiger Mountain Trail. In a short distance, turn left again at a rustic sign, this time onto the Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT) itself.<br><br>The route starts out fairly level, then gains elevation with many switchbacks. In 1.25 miles the trail straightens and begins a long southward stretch along one side of a narrowing canyon, termed Anshell&apos;s Allee. Just beyond the Allee, cross two tributaries of High Point Creek on secure bridges. <br><br>After the two bridges, come to an intersection with the K3 Trail. It&apos;s signed &quot;unmaintained,&quot; but it&apos;s maintained by volunteers so is as good as any trail in the Tigers. From here, the TMT makes a long loop to the east then loops back west at a higher elevation. The K3 takes a shortcut across that loop. It&apos;s steeper, but it&apos;s 1.5 miles shorter. Well, you are out to hike the TMT, aren&apos;t you? So don&apos;t cheat. Of course, if you hike far enough on the TMT, you can keep K3 in mind for your return leg when saving that extra 1.5 miles may seem very welcome. (If you take K3 on your return, the round trip to Custer&apos;s Bridge is about 14 miles.)<br><br>About a half-mile farther, come to the first crossing of High Point Creek. A few years ago a bridge here was heavily damaged by flood waters and blowdowns. It now sits tilted, off its moorings, and sections of its railings are missing. Chains at either end support &quot;bridge closed&quot; signs. Other postings have, in the past couple of years, hinted a replacement was due soon, but it hasn&apos;t happened yet. When the water level is low there is no problem crossing the creek on boulders.<br><br>In another 0,1 mile, come to the T-junction with the High Point Trail (it arrives here from I-90, Exit 20, by a different route than the TMT.) At this point, you have come 2.6 miles from your trailhead and, for an easy hike, this is a possible turn-around point.<br><br>Or press on an additional half mile, passing a signed junction with the Lingering Trail, to reach Ruth&apos;s Cove. It&apos;s a pleasant spot where a new small bridge crosses a tributary of High Point Creek. In spring, skunk cabbage blooms here. Ruth&apos;s is a nice place to pause for a break. It&apos;s just over three miles from your trailhead, and is another possibility for a turn around.<br><br>A couple of hundred feet past Ruth&apos;s Cove, look on the left for a very small fir that often is decorated with a few holiday bangles, even in summer. It&apos;s one of two (at least) such trees in the Tigers (another is near the Bootleg Trail above the Paw Print Connector.) It&apos;s not known who keeps up the decorations, or who sometimes removes them.<br><br>Continue on to Fred&apos;s Corner, a trail junction in an area of tall maples. While you are there, look up in the trees. It&apos;s not unusual to see a few wild pigeons - very different birds from their urban, street-smart cousins. The trail forks here, with the West Tiger RR Grade heading left and the TMT going right. <br><br>In 0.3 miles the route starts to level off. Formerly, the TMT crossed High Point Creek on a bridge here, then traversed a former landslide before coming to a junction with the West Tiger RR Grade and continuing on uphill. If you have hiked this part of the TMT before you probably remember this section and your map may still show it as the route.<br><br>In early 2014, the bridge was removed and in the summer of 2014 an entire section of the TMT was rerouted to avoid the former landslide and to bridge High Point Creek at a more secure location upstream.<br><br>Before reaching the former bridge site, the TMT now turns left (uphill.) Take this newly- constructed section of the TMT and soon cross High Point Creek on a new, very secure bridge. Climb a bit more, then enjoy a nearly&#xAD;level section of trail that meets up with the old route at the upper end of the K3Trail. Keep the K3 in mind for the return leg of your hike.<br><br>Continue on (up) to Tom&apos;s Crossing, actually a T-junction. At about 2,500 feet, it&apos;s the highest point along the TMT so you have come up about 2,000 feet from the trailhead. In spring, look for red currant blooming here. (From the junction, the West Tiger #2 Trail climbs steeply, gaining another 270 feet, to reach that summit.) Stay with the ongoing TMT as it drops a little, passing though a section of forest with a dense canopy and little growth in the understory. In 0.3 mile from Tom&apos;s Crossing, reach Pete&apos;s Pass where the TMT crosses the ridge between the West Tiger #2 and #3 summits, each less than a quarter mile away.<br><br>Press on five minutes to Manning&apos;s Reach where a very small bench offers room for one or two hikers to sit. There is a minimal view through the trees down to the lowlands, although tree growth is shrinking even this window and it may disappear in a year or two. Manning&apos;s Reach is another of the high points on the TMT and, like Tom&apos;s Crossing, has an elevation about 2,500 feet. If you continue on to Custer&apos;s Bridge you will drop about 440 feet - and have to regain it on your return. If this is unappealing you could turn around here.<br><br>Or continue on 1.25 miles to a junction with the One View Trail (a route to Poo Poo Point, or to the High School Trail.) Then, in another 0.1 mile, come to Larry&apos;s Crossing and the intersection with the Hidden Forest Trail (Left, uphill, goes to the West Tiger #1 summit, in about a mile. Right, downhill, connects with the Fifteen Mile RR Grade and, eventually, the West Side Road.) <br><br>In another on 0.1 mile on the TMT come to the fancifully-named Hopping Bridge crossing a small, seasonal stream. Yes, there are a few rabbits in the Tigers, but it&apos;s unlikely you will see any here.<br><br>Continue on a bit more than a mile, passing Dieter&apos;s Spring and, at about 7.25 miles from the trailhead, reach Lone Rock, a glacial erratic boulder perched quietly amid the trees next to the TMT. If your previous Tiger hikes have included the Talus Rocks Trail then you have seen boulders of comparable size. But those, on the moist north side of West Tiger, are heavily covered in moss. Lone Rock, here on the drier south side, is not so adorned, and the characteristics of the stone can be appreciated more readily. Take a close-up look, run your hand over it, and perhaps scramble part way around to compare the different sides. Then consider whether you might want to turn around here.<br><br>Or you can continue on, about another half mile. Drop down a hundred feet or so and cross the signed Fifteen Mile RR Grade. Drop a bit more and, a couple of minutes later, come to Custer&apos;s Bridge. It&apos;s as remote a spot as you are likely to find anywhere in the Tigers, in terms of distance to a trailhead. So you might have it all to yourself.<br><br>The bridge, located near the midpoint of the TMT, is a low, rustic structure crossing the head of Fifteen Mile Creek. In spring, look along the banks for skunk cabbage. In summer, when the vegetation is so thick you may have difficulty seeing down to the water, look for ripe salmon berries and a few wildflowers. Any time, spring through fall, the bridge is a pleasant stopping point. Sit a while, sip and snack, and relax to the soft sounds of the flowing stream.<br><br>If you haven&apos;t turned around already you really should now. You&apos;ve hiked half the TMT, some would say the better half. It&apos;s almost eight miles back to your trailhead (less if you take K3,) and you have to regain the 440 feet of elevation you dropped getting here from Manning&apos;s Reach. Perhaps you have caught &quot;TMT fever,&quot; that uncontrollable urge to see what&apos;s around the next corner on the TMT? That&apos;s OK. It happens. Come back tomorrow, or in a few days. Start at the south end and hike north to Custer&apos;s Bridge. Then you will have experienced it all. Better yet, collaborate with a friend, arrange a car shuffle, and do the entire TMT as a through hike starting at the south end. It&apos;s a worthy adventure.</p>\n                 ",

There are many trails which start or finish around I-90&#x2019;s &#x201C;High Point Way&#x201D; exit 20, but Tiger 3 is one of the best trainers in the area.

However, Tiger-3 is well signed as it heads initially west and then quickly south from the southwest end of the parking lot. Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. <br><br>The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress. Being an old road, the way is wide, and so many users enjoy this trail. Winter can be an extra special time for families with it&#x2019;s close proximity to the city.<br><br>The last half-mile mile flattens out just slightly as it crosses and recrosses the Cable Trail which ascends relentlessly and unceremoniously from I-90 along the hill&#x2019;s steepest grade.

But you&apos;re still on the High Point Trail. The sign is there because this is the former location of a junction with the Lingering Trail. That trail has been rerouted, and you now will pass the junction 100 yards south of the power line. (The Lingering Trail is an option for your return hike.)<br><br>Continue south on the High Point Trail about 0.4 miles, come to a signed junction with Dwight&apos;s Way, turn left and climb a few steps. Continue on Dwight&apos;s Way about 0.7 miles, crossing over the Lingering Trail.<br><br>Dwight&apos;s Way has some gentle ups and downs with a net gain of about 100 feet. Along the way enjoy some of the nicest second-growth forest in the Tigers. Cross small streams on rustic bridges and, in one case, on a large log. Appreciate the exuberant growth of moss and ferns, and note occasional huge stumps, remnants from logging a century ago.<br><br>Reach a signed junction with the Preston Trail (formerly the &quot;West Tiger No. 1 Trail,&quot; a name your Green Trails map still may use.) At this point, prepare for some uphill. You&apos;ll gain about 350 feet before the grade begins to level off.<br><br>After 0.4 miles on the Preston Trail you might notice a faint trail merging with your route on your left, but you would be forgiven for thinking it&apos;s just another path where water runs off the trail. Actually, it&apos;s the route shown on your map as the Lower Bootleg Trail, a path that arrives here (via part of the Preston Trail) from near the D.O.T. Highway Facility on SE Preston Way. Also, it&apos;s part of a route by which a few mountain bikers access these trails, even though the trails officially are closed to bikers. You might not encounter bikers on your hike, but you could see tire tracks here, and along the ongoing Bootleg Trail if you return via that route.<br><br>Continue on another 0.1 miles and come to a signed trail junction where the Middle Bootleg Trail heads off left. The ongoing Preston Trail, your route, climbs steeply uphill to the right. Gain about 500 feet in a half-mile, cross over a gently rounded knoll, and enjoy a brief stretch of downhill. But it&apos;s elevation you will have to gain back.<br><br>At the low point, where the uphill resumes, note an old railroad grade heading left with a faint path visible along it. If you are here on a future hike and feel adventurous that&apos;s a path you could explore. It&apos;s rudimentary, but it does go through to join the Bootleg Trail. For today, just stay on the Preston Trail, climb another 100 feet and reach a signed trail junction where the West Tiger RR Grade arrives from Fred&apos;s Corner. <br><br>By now you probably are thinking this hike has a lot of uphill. It does, and there&apos;s more. Stay on the Preston Trail and climb another 600 feet in a half-mile to reach a signed junction with the upper end of the Bootleg Trail. <br><br>From here, the ongoing Preston Trail continues west below a ridge top. In 2014, the slope above the trail was clear-cut. Trees at the edge of the trail now are subject to the full force of storm winds, and there have been some blowdowns.<br><br>As of early 2015, this part of the Preston Trail was completely blocked by a massive blowdown. (Check recent trip reports for the current status, and for any advice.) <br><br>In less than a quarter-mile, come to a signed junction with the Poo Top Trail. Here, to reach the summit of W. Tiger No. 1 (or as close as an electronics tower will allow) you need to take a short side trip. Hike up the Poo Top Trail, gaining about 75 feet on four short switchbacks to reach a high point next to a large granite boulder. At 2948 feet, this is the second highest summit in the Tigers (only East Tiger, at 3004 feet, is higher.) It may seem somewhat anti-climactic, both because of the adjoining tower, and because there is no view. But don&apos;t despair! You soon will have your view. <br><br>The Poo Top Trail continues on south to meet up with the Hidden Forest Trail, but that&apos;s for a different hike! For today, turn around and take the Poo Top Trail back down to the Preston Trail (from this side the sign says it&apos;s the Bypass Trail, because it bypasses the electronics.) Turn left and continue west on the Preston/Bypass Trail a quarter mile. Pass through some very dark forest and emerge abruptly into the bright sun (clouds permitting) at the Hiker&apos;s Hut Viewpoint.<br><br>The hut itself is a small, round metal structure that might serve as a very basic storm shelter in winter. A graveled service road arrives here from the west to reach the electronics gear, and a bench is available across the road. Sit and take in the view. On a clear day, Mt. Rainier will be directly in front of you and of a large swath of the Olympics will be visible to your right. <br><br>While you are at the viewpoint, you may be visited by a few gray jays. Humming birds also often are seen here and, in summer, large dragon flies. In spring, check the surroundings for wildflowers such as lupine and tiger lily (a few years ago tiger lilies bloomed right under the bench!)<br><br>When you have had your fill of the view, and finished your lunch, it&apos;s time to think of returning. Either return the way you came, possibly taking the optional Lingering Trail, or see below for another possibility.<br><br><br><br>Extending your hike<br><br>On your hike up to W. Tiger No. 1 you passed two ends of the Bootleg Trail, so it&apos;s an obvious option for your return hike that will add about a half-mile to your distance.<br><br>If you decide to return that way then, when you reach the junction at the upper end of the Bootleg Trail, turn right, follow it a short distance below the ridge top, then begin to descend steeply. At the point where the trail steepens, another short trail arrives from the right. It just leads up to the ridge top service road. (If, in the future, you are hiking the Bootleg Trail in the uphill direction, be alert for this unsigned junction near the ridge top, and watch for a large red arrow painted on a tree trunk to indicate where the Bootleg Trail bends west.)<br><br>Descend the Bootleg Trail another 0.6 miles and approach a junction with the Paw Print Connector. Above the junction you might notice, off to your right, a small fir tree that sports holiday decorations, even in summer. It&apos;s one of two (at least) such trees in the Tigers (another is along the TMT above Ruth&apos;s Cove.) It is not known who adds the decorations, or who sometimes removes them.<br><br>Continue down the Bootleg Trail. Eventually, it reaches another old railroad grade and abruptly levels out. The trail may seem to go both directions along the railroad grade, but the left branch is your ongoing trail. The right branch used to be very indistinct, but in recent years it has enjoyed more traffic and become more visible. It connects with an old logging road that is shown on your Green Trails map.<br><br>Beyond the railroad grade, cross the East Fork of Issaquah Creek. Generally, this is an easy crossing on stones although the water level can be higher after a recent heavy rain, or when snow is melting above. After the crossing, continue down the Bootleg Trail to reach its junction with the Preston Trail. Follow the Preston Trail back to Dwight&apos;s Way, and return to your trailhead.<br><br>Optionally, along Dwight&apos;s Way, when you come to the crossing of the Lingering Trail you can turn right and take it back to rejoin the High Point Trail above the power line.</p>\n                 ",

Come to a metal gate adorned with crude lettering &quot;No Trespassing.&quot; That&apos;s just meant to discourage unauthorized vehicles. Hikers are welcome to proceed around the right end of the gate on a short trail signed &quot;W.

There&apos;s not much of a view. A signed trail continues on west 0.4 miles to the ever-popular W. Tiger No. 3 summit. But, unless you are seeking lots of company, or are intent on traversing all three West Tiger summits today, don&apos;t go there.<br><br>Like many Tiger summits, W.

Today, hikers and horse riders can enjoy the cool forests and gentle trails year-round, even November through May when the high-country Cascades are locked in snow.<br><br>Red Town. Coal Creek Town.

Local tribes hunted these woods, gathered foodstuffs in the meadows, and harvested cedar for various uses.<br><br>As you hike the Wildside Trail (W1) you&apos;ll cross the clear waters of Coal Creek in a deep gorge, striding past an old homesite (the Wash House). Stay left at the junction with the Rainbow Town Trail to continue a scenic woodland walk to a high old mine site, where you&apos;ll find a massive concrete piling.

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Coal Creek Falls is a wonderful destination for any day hiker looking for an easy, family friendly trail with a picturesque culmination at Coal Creek Falls. It&#x2019;s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy of maple, alder, and cedar trees and between a dense understory of salmonberry, ferns, and numerous wildflower species in the spring.<br><br>The popular trailhead is located in the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildlife Park. There is a veritable maze of trails and trailheads here so it is helpful to bring along a map of the area. <br><br>Cougar Mountain was extremely busy with coal mining from 1863-1963. The miners tunneled six miles under the mountain and strip mined the surface, eventually hauling out 11 million tons of bituminous coal. Remnants of the mining past are obvious when you see the large holes in the ground alongside the trail. These &#x201C;cave holes&#x201D; were formed when miner&#x2019;s underground extractions got too close to the surface, which eventually led to cave-ins. Be sure to stay on the trail so as to avoid the deeper and potentially dangerous cave holes. One of the larger holes in the area is rumored to go 518 feet below sea level.<br><br>The forest endured logging in the past and there are some pretty remarkably large stumps left behind to remind you of what was once there. There is a fair amount of stinging nettle edging the trail, so be sure to stay on the marked route!<br><br>From the trailhead veer left following the Red Town Trail. The trail starts off very wide.  At the first trail junction, 0.1 miles in, veer left, joining the Cave Hole Trail. The trail gets a bit narrower here but it is still wide enough for vehicles. <br><br>After 0.2 miles along the Cave Hole Trail, you will encounter another trail junction, continue along the Cave Hole Trail for an additional 0.4 miles where you will reach your third trail junction. Here, veer to the right to begin along the Coal Creek Falls Trail. The trail becomes much more narrow here. <br><br>This trail used to be notorious for its muddy conditions but thanks to a reroute completed by WTA in 2014 your shoes should stay relatively clean.  As the trail begins to descend you should hear the sound of running water from nearby Coal Creek. <br><br>After a short set of stairs going down it&#x2019;s just 0.3 miles further and you reach Coal Creek Falls! This 28 foot waterfall is fueled by runoff and has its best flows in the rainy, winter months. The falls do run dry during the summer months, usually mid June to whenever the rainy season starts up again in the winter.<br><br>There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, but it&#x2019;s heavily used and fills up quickly. The trailhead is equipped with two privies, garbage cans, a picnic table, historical interpretive signage, and doggie bag dispenser.</p>\n                 ",

The route climbs to one of the highest points in the western Issaquah Alps, and along the way you&apos;ll find plenty of open viewpoints to take in the scenery of the central Puget Sound basin. The military early on recognized the value of these high peaks and built a missile launch and missile-command radar station atop Anti-Aircraft Peak.<br><br>The route starts by rounding the gate and heading up the road toward the Newcastle Brick Works clay pit. At about 0.75 mile you&apos;ll leave the road by veering left onto the Klondike Swamp Trail. This swampy basin was once a shallow impoundment behind a long dam across these headwaters of Coal Creek. The lake behind the dam filled with sediment (largely the result of runoff from area logging), creating the current boggy swamp. Birds of all varieties thrive in this accidental ecosystem--even wood ducks!<br><br>A mile into your hike through this rich environment, go left onto Lost Beagle Trail. (Was that lost beagle lured away by the abundant wildlife? Perhaps, so keep your own dog on-leash please). The trail climbs slightly through the wild woods to a reminder of this area&apos;s military might--a high fence around Radar Park. Continue along the trail as it skirts the park perimeter and, shortly after crossing the access road leading into the park compound, stop and enjoy the best views of the day at a small knob locals have dubbed Million Dollar View. The panoramic splendor includes Mount Baker in the North Cascades (on especially clear days) to the Seattle skyline and the Olympic Mountains beyond.<br><br>After soaking in the scenery at the top, descend along the Shangri La Trail a short 0.1 mile before going right and then right again at the very next junction. This puts you on Anti-Aircraft Ridge Trail. Shortly, you&apos;ll encounter yet another fork in the trail. (Warning: There are myriad trails here, and if signposts get knocked down it&apos;s easy to take a wrong turn--a great reason to carry a map.) To the right is Lost Beagle Trail, leading straight back to your starting point. Go left instead to descend along Anti-Aircraft Ridge.<br><br>You&apos;ll soon find yourself at Cougar Pass (elev. 1250 ft)--about 1.25 miles from Million Dollar View. This pass separates the drainages of Coal Creek and West Tibbetts Creek. Go right to cut your hike short (this leads straight down to the Klondike Swamp Trail), or stay left for the longer loop. This path skirts another swamp before merging into Tibbetts Marsh Trail. Stay right and climb a long 0.25 mile to the blue-sky views above the open cuts of the clay pits (elev. 1375 ft).

Most of the trail is across open scree and talus slopes with great views of Deep Lake below, then returns to the woods, past a few logs remaining from an old cabin, and then to Peggy&apos;s Pond itself, which is surrounded by huckleberry meadows and several campsites.\n\nContinuing West from Peggy&apos;s Pond are numerous informal trails leading to the Hyas Glacier, Mount Daniel, and Circle Lake.\n                 ",

As the raven flies, the distance from the southern end of the TMT to the northern end is about 7.5 miles. On the trail, it&apos;s over 15 miles of forest wandering. <br><br>Along the way, hike through deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests, past areas with decaying stumps from century-old logging and at the southern end, through a few clear-cut areas that have been recently logged. Encounter moist areas with small creeks and an abundance of ferns and shrubs, drier areas with quite different vegetation, and areas where the forest canopy is so dense that little grows in the understory. Look for and appreciate these differences as you do the hike.<br><br>See a variety of forest wildflowers in season. In early spring look for trillium, yellow violet, bleeding heart and coltsfoot; a bit later miner&apos;s lettuce, vanilla leaf, salmon berry and red currant; in late June or early July, tiger lily, goatsbeard, foamflower, mimulus, and thimble berry. Many other less common wildflowers are out there. If in doubt, take a photo and consult a wildflower guide at home.<br><br>On your hike, you may notice rustic signs with quaint names such as Joe&apos;s Hollow, Manning&apos;s Reach, Ruth&apos;s Cove, and others like these. They were intended as a tribute to the volunteers who built the TMT in the 1970s. Some of the names are shown on the Green Trails map. Small markers were installed each mile to indicate the distance from the southern end, while here and there other markers were installed displaying just the letters &quot;TMT.&quot; Sadly, in recent years many signs and original markers have disappeared, their fate unknown. Be alert for the remaining ones as you hike.<br><br>From the trailhead, follow the TMT along the grade of the former Woods and Iverson railroad, built in the early days of logging to haul timber from the Tigers to a mill in Hobart. It&apos;s a quieter walk today, although you may hear some traffic sounds from nearby Highway 18. In early spring, some of the first trilliums to bloom in the Tigers will be found along this part of the trail<br><br>The first 4.5 miles of the TMT are shared with trail riders (equestrians), and at 1.1 miles, a sign directs them to turn right onto the &quot;Horse Bypass&quot; while your trail continues straight ahead. In another 0.2 miles, your way narrows and traverses the steep hillside of Carkin&apos;s Cliff. This precarious trail is the reason horses take a different route. Beyond the traverse, arrive at the sign identifying Hobart Gap, where the foot and horse trails rejoin.<br><br>Continue east on the ongoing trail and in 0.8 miles, reach a powerline. Head northeast under the powerline (the route is shared by the TMT and the South Tiger Powerline Trail.) In about 200 yards, turn left at the sign where the TMT leaves the powerline. <br><br>Stay with the TMT as it traverses 1.2 miles around the east side of South Tiger Mountain. Along the way, listen for the sounds of Holder Creek below. The trail widens and is joined on the left by the South Tiger Traverse -- it may be shown on your map as a trail, but this end of the Traverse served briefly as a logging road a few years ago so it looks like an old forest road. Continue north on the TMT and in an additional 0.1 mile, cross the West Side Road (Road 1000), one of several non-public service roads in the Tigers.<br><br>Beyond the road, traverse the lower edge of a clear-cut area, then make a very sharp left turn at Zeig&apos;s Zag. About 0.2 mile beyond the Zag, the TMT is crossed by a logging road that leads up clear-cut Karl&apos;s Peak, a minor viewpoint. From the TMT itself, you can see East Tiger Mountain--at 3,004 feet the highest point in the Tigers--and, in the distance to your right, part of the summit dome of Mount Rainier may be visible, clouds permitting.<br><br>Continue, following an old railroad grade through forested areas around the west and north sides of Karl&apos;s Peak, then skirt more clear-cut area before entering mature forest again. At 1.6 miles from Zeig&apos;s Zag, come to Millan&apos;s Crossing. To the right, the Middle Tiger Trail climbs over 400 feet to the 2,607 foot summit of Middle Tiger (no view.) To the left, the Middle Tiger Trail drops steeply 900 feet to reach the Hobart-Middle Tiger RR Grade, a worthy hike in its own right. For today, continue on along the TMT.<br><br>Traverse around the forested south, west and north sides of Middle Tiger Mountain, passing several named locations. Keep an eye out for the signs! At 1.2 miles from Millan&apos;s Crossing, note a sign for &quot;Hobart Grade&quot; with an arrow seeming to point straight ahead. Don&apos;t go there! That&apos;s an unofficial route that drops down to the Hobart-Middle Tiger RR Grade. Stay on the TMT, which makes an easily-overlooked right turn here, just when your eye might be distracted by the Hobart Grade sign.<br><br>Arrive soon at Paul&apos;s Cove, a moist area that, in early summer, displays a good flowering of pink mimulus. A half mile beyond Paul&apos;s Cove, reach the approximate mid-point of your hike at Custer&apos;s Bridge.<br><br>Custer&apos;s Bridge is as remote a spot as you are likely to find anywhere in the Tigers, in terms of distance to a trailhead. So you might have it all to yourself. The bridge is a low, rustic structure crossing the head of Fifteen Mile Creek. In spring, look along the banks for skunk cabbage. In summer, when the vegetation is so thick you may have difficulty seeing down to the water, look for ripe salmon berries and a few wildflowers. Any time, spring through fall, the bridge is a pleasant stopping point, so why not pause here, enjoy a sip and a snack, and relax for a few minutes to the soft sounds of the flowing stream?<br><br>When you are ready to continue, climb a bit on the TMT and cross the Fifteen Mile RR Grade. Climb a bit more and, a half-mile from Custer&apos;s Bridge, come to Lone Rock, a glacial erratic boulder perched quietly amid the trees next to the TMT. If your previous Tiger hikes have included the Talus Rocks Trail then you have seen boulders of comparable size. But those on the moist north side of West Tiger are heavily covered in moss. Lone Rock, here on the drier south side, is less adorned, and the characteristics of the stone can be appreciated more readily. Take a close-up look, run your hand over it, and perhaps scramble part way around to compare the different sides. <br><br>Continue on another mile, passing Wally&apos;s Glen, and cross the small, fancifully-named Hopping Bridge. It crosses a small, seasonal stream that may be dry when you do your hike. And, though there are a few rabbits in the Tigers but it&apos;s unlikely you will see any here.<br><br>In another 0.2 mile pass Larry&apos;s Crossing and an intersection with the Hidden Forest Trail. Going right, uphill, would lead you about a mile to the West Tiger #1 summit at 2,948 feet. Going left, downhill, would take you to the Fifteen Mile RR Grade and, eventually, the West Side Road.<br><br>Stay on the TMT and, in another 0.1 mile, come to a junction with the One View Trail. This is a route to Poo Poo Point or to the High School Trail. <br><br>On the next 1.4 miles of the TMT, cross the head of Many Creeks Valley. The numerous creeks here are small, and most are seasonal. The vegetation often is particularly lush along this section of the TMT. Farther along, come to Manning&apos;s Reach where a very small bench offers room for one or two hikers to sit. There is a minimal view through the trees down to the lowlands, although tree growth is shrinking that window so it may disappear in a year or two. Manning&apos;s Reach is one of the high points on the TMT at an elevation of about 2,500 feet. <br><br>Drop slightly, and in 0.1 mile reach Pete&apos;s Pass where the TMT crosses the ridge between West Tiger Mountain&apos;s #2 and #3 summits, each of them less than a quarter mile away. Continue on the TMT, traversing an area with very little growth in the understory. Press on to Tom&apos;s Crossing, actually a T-junction. At just over 2,500 feet, it&apos;s the highest point on the TMT. In spring, look for red currant blooming here. From Tom&apos;s Crossing, the West Tiger #2 Trail heads steeply uphill providing another way to reach that summit.<br><br>Continue down the TMT on many switchbacks and, in about 0.3 mile, note the junction with the K3 Trail. From here, the TMT takes a long loop to the east, then swings back west at a lower elevation. The K3 Trail is a shortcut across that loop, cutting off about 1.5 miles. Tempted? Wait! You are out to do a through-hike on the TMT! So save the K3 information for a future hike. You might wonder about the K3 sign that says &quot;Unmaintained Trail.&quot; That just means it relies on volunteers for maintenance; it&apos;s as good as any trail in the Tigers.<br><br>Until 2014, the TMT switchbacked steeply downhill from its junction with the K3, passing a junction with the West Tiger RR Grade, then traversing a former gritty landslide and crossing a bridge over High Point Creek. If you have hiked this part of the TMT before you probably remember this section and your map may still show it as the route.<br><br>In early 2014, the bridge was removed and in the summer of 2014 an entire section of the TMT was rerouted to avoid the former landslide and to bridge High Point Creek at a more secure location upstream.<br><br>From the K3 junction, take the new section of the TMT. If the arrows on the metal trail sign seem somewhat confusing, check the wooden sign on the left side of the trail. It shows clearly which is the TMT. Head generally south, initially with a gently downhill grade that steepens later. Then cross High Point Creek on a new, very secure bridge. A bit further along, meet up with the old route, make a right turn there, and you are back on the familiar part of the TMT. <br><br>Continue on to Fred&apos;s Corner, a trail junction in an area of tall maples. While you are there, look up in the trees. It&apos;s not unusual to see a few wild pigeons, very different birds from their urban, street-smart cousins. The trail forks here, with the West Tiger RR Grade heading uphill to the right and the TMT continuing on downhill. <br><br>Descend the TMT from Fred&apos;s Corner and, when the trail levels out in about 0.4 miles, look on the right for a very small fir that often is decorated with a few holiday bangles, even in summer. It&apos;s one of two (at least) such trees in the Tigers (another is near the Bootleg Trail above the Paw Print Connector.) It&apos;s not known who keeps up the decorations, or who sometimes removes them.<br><br>About 200 feet past the tree, reach Ruth&apos;s Cove. It&apos;s a pleasant spot where a new small bridge crosses a tributary of High Point Creek. In spring, skunk cabbage blooms here. This is a good place to pause for a quick break.<br><br>Beyond Ruth&apos;s Cove, descend some more and pass signed junctions with the Lingering Trail and the High Point Trail. Just beyond the High Point Trail, reach the lower crossing of High Point Creek. A few years ago a bridge here was heavily damaged by flood waters and blowdowns. It now sits tilted, off its moorings, and sections of its railings are missing. Chains at either end support &quot;Bridge Closed&quot; signs. Other postings have hinted replacement was due soon, but it as of summer 2014, it hasn&apos;t happened. When the water level is low there is no problem crossing the creek just upstream on boulders.<br><br>A half-mile west of High Point Creek, note the junction with the lower end of the K3 Trail. From here, you have about two more miles to go to finish your TMT hike. Beyond the K3 junction, cross two tributaries of High Point Creek on sturdy bridges, then come to a long, relatively straight section of the TMT termed &quot;Anschell&apos;s Allee.&quot; Once you are past the Allee, descend about 900 feet, with many switchbacks. Then cross the &quot;Cable Route,&quot; that infamous and unofficial trail up West Tiger #3 fancied by exercise enthusiasts.<br><br>Beyond the Cable Route, the TMT becomes less steep and has fewer switchbacks. Soon, it levels out completely and merges, first with the West Tiger #3 Trail, then with the wide, graveled trail that leads north a quarter mile to the developed High Point Trailhead - a real contrast to the completely undeveloped trailhead at the TMT&apos;s south end.<br><br>At the High Point trailhead, pat yourself on the back; you have completed the TMT! Congratulations on completing this classic Tiger Mountain hike. If you found some surprises along the way, or had unusual wildlife or wildflower sightings, or if you found conditions much changed from what is described here, please consider writing a trip report. We&apos;d enjoy hearing the highlights of your experience hiking the TMT.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>From the trailhead, follow the TMT along the grade of the former Woods and Iverson railroad, built in the early days of logging to haul timber from the Tigers to a mill in Hobart. It&apos;s a quieter walk today, although you may hear some traffic sounds from nearby Highway 18. In early spring, some of the first trilliums to bloom in the Tigers will be found along this part of the trail.<br><br>Your hike follows trails shared with trail riders (equestrians) and, at 1.1 miles, a sign directs riders to turn onto the &quot;Horse Bypass&quot; while your trail continues straight ahead. In another 0.2 mile, your trail narrows and traverses the steep hillside of Carkin&apos;s Cliff - the reason horses take a different route. Beyond the traverse, arrive at the sign identifying Hobart Gap, where the foot and horse trails rejoin.<br><br>Continue east on the ongoing trail and, in 0.8 miles, reach a powerline. Head northeast under the powerline (the route is shared by the TMT and the South Tiger Powerline Trail.) In about 200 yards, turn left at the sign where the TMT leaves the powerline. <br><br>Stay with the TMT as it traverses 1.1 miles around the east side of South Tiger Mountain. Along the way you will begin to hear the sounds of Holder Creek below. The trail widens and is joined from the left by the South Tiger Traverse.This may be shown on your map as a trail, but that part of the Traverse served briefly as a logging road a few years ago, so it looks more like an old forest road. <br><br>Turn sharply left onto the South Tiger Traverse (road) and follow it uphill. As it begins to level off there is an apparent fork in the trail, with the former logging road heading left and another wide path heading right. An unhelpful sign proclaiming &quot;South Tiger Traverse&quot; is posted in the middle of the fork, with no indication which branch is preferred. <br><br>Take the fork to the right of the sign and, when the trail levels out completely, look for a signpost on the left. (As of Jan 2015, the sign is missing.) The former sign indicated a trail to the right that climbs a small knoll to reach the Carole Hapke Lunch Area. The actual Traverse heads south on the left, behind the now-unsigned post. <br><br>You can check out the Hapke Lunch Area if you like, but it&apos;s mostly favored by equestrians. A short, rough trail climbs about 100 feet to the top of a small knoll where there is a hitching bar for horses and a fire pit. A few years ago the knoll offered a view of Middle and East Tiger Mountains. But small trees have grown vigorously. Later, the view still was available to anyone who scrambled up a tall stump. But the trees have outgrown even that height, and today there is no view at all.<br><br>Your ongoing trail, the South Tiger Traverse, continues on south behind the signpost. It passes through an area that was logged a few years ago. An occasional tree was left standing, and today there is a vigorous growth of small trees, brush and fireweed that is much easier on the eyes than the scene immediately following logging.<br><br>The route exits the cut-over area and enters the forest. In about 300 yards, be alert for a large stump on the left, a remnant from logging a century ago.  Two cut marks near the top suggest eyes, and helpful hikers have scratched in a mouth below to complete the face, but continuing decay may obliterate the &quot;smile&quot; in a few years.<br><br>At the north side of the stump take the unsigned, but venerable trail that climbs a quarter mile up to the south summit of South Tiger Mountain, gaining about 250 feet. At worst you may have to step over or duck under an occasional blowdown, and soon you will be on top. The summit is forested, and there is no view. A USGS survey marker is located within a ring of stones, and the official elevation is 2028 feet.<br><br>True mountain climbers would smile at the thought of calling it a &quot;summit,&quot; but a few years ago South Tiger Mountain actually offered a summit register for climbers to add their names to document their achievement. The register, unfortunately, has been gone for a while now, but you could write a trip report and include a selfie!<br><br>To continue, descend back to the South Tiger Traverse the way you came, or see Extending Your Hike for an optional visit to the north summit. <br><br>Either way, end up back on the South Tiger Traverse. Continue on south and eventually come to the powerline. Cross directly under the powerline, pass by a generator, and find yourself on another forest road.<br><br>Take the road downhill, curve around to the right, and come to another trail. Not familiar? Turn sharply left, walk a few feet, and you will be back at Hobart Gap.<br><br>From the Gap, take the TMT back across Carkin&apos;s Cliff, and continue on to the trailhead.<br><br>Extending Your Hike<br><br>North Summit of South Tiger Mountain<br>From the south summit, peer through the trees to the north and you can make out the contours of the north summit about a quarter mile away. It may be a few feet higher than the south summit and, because it was logged a few years ago, it offers the views you are denied on the south summit.<br><br>Going to the north summit is optional because the first part of the route is quite rudimentary (as of summer 2014.) If you opt to try it, look for a faint path leaving the south summit and heading through the trees toward the north summit. When the path leaves the trees and enters the logged-over area, the next 100 feet or so may be overgrown and somewhat prickly. But persevere, and you soon will come to a good trail. (The trail is not shown on your map, but it&apos;s a continuation of the logging road that takes the left fork from that ambiguous sign.) Turn right on that trail and follow it all the way to the north summit. Like the Hapke Lunch Area, the north summit is visited by equestrians and offers hitching anchors for horses, and a fire pit. <br><br>From the summit, enjoy the view toward the north. East Tiger Mountain is the one with the towers, and is the highest point in the Tigers, at 3004 feet. To the left of East Tiger you can see the rounded, still-forested dome of Middle Tiger Mountain standing at 2607 feet. The high point to the right of East Tiger is known in trip reports as Sally&apos;s Summit, although that name has not yet made it onto the topo map. Sally&apos;s Summit is at 2786 feet; the third highest point in the Tigers, after East Tiger and West Tiger #1 at 2948 feet. If you have not been to these other Tiger high points they are possibilities for future hikes.<br><br>Your best option now may be to return to the South Tiger Traverse the way you have come, first going back to the south summit, then taking the trail back down to the Traverse.</p>\n                 ",

This area is rich with wildlife, from the winged variety (woodpeckers, flickers, red-tailed hawks, Stellar&apos;s jays) to the four-legged kind (deer, bobcats, black bears, cougars, martens, coyotes, raccoons, beavers). There are also the usual suspects when it comes to forest flora--with a variety of trees, bushes, wildflowers, ferns, and mosses--and the usual suspects in summer when it comes to mosquitoes, so visit in fall through spring for swat-free hiking.<br><br>The first leg of this hike starts on the West Side Road. The wide road is still used for limited logging operations, and a few individuals have keys to the gate so they can get their hang gliders to the launch site on Poo Poo Point.

Neither hike is particularly difficult; they just require endurance and some good aerobic conditioning because of their lengths. No matter your destination, though, you&apos;ll have plenty of company. The North Fork Skokomish River valley has been attracting legions of hikers ever since Lieutenant O&apos;Neil and his boys passed this way shortly after Washington became a state.<br><br>The North Fork Skokomish Trail will satisfy your hiking desires whether you amble up it for 1 mile or 10. The first 3.5 miles were once a road. Decommissioned in the early 1970s, it now makes for a wide and well-graded path. The trail follows part of the O&apos;Neil Party&apos;s 1890 exploratory route. Several months after the famous Press Expedition, which traversed the Olympic interior from north to south, Lieutenant O&apos;Neil led a group of scientists and soldiers across the Olympics from east to west.<br><br>Immediately start with a view up the wild valley. At 0.5 mile cross Slate Creek, fed by a little lake high on Mount Lincoln. Cross a luxuriant bottomland of massive cedars and firs-a few big big-leaf maples too! Cross a small creek and large outwash area, and at 1 mile come to the Staircase Rapids Trail. The bridge has been out for years. If it ever gets replaced, this trail makes a nice loop for children and those short on time.<br><br>The main trail continues right, coming within earshot and eyesight of the tumbling North Fork. A few nice riverbank flats can be accessed along the way. At 1.25 miles pass the Slide Camp access, leading to good camp and picnic sites on the river. Proceed past remnants of a 1986 slide and emerge at the edge of a 1985 burn. Thanks to a careless camper, 1400 acres of our old-growth heritage went up in flames. Thankfully, nature forgives, and the area has been nicely recovering.<br><br>At 2 miles emerge on a small rise in the burnt-over area, which offers good views of the bowing river. Now climbing gradually, move away from the waterway through a forest of new greenery and resilient giants sporting blackened trunks. At 3.4 miles reach the junction to Flapjack Lakes at Spike Camp (elev. 1450 ft).<br><br>Big Log Camp: For Big Log Camp, head straight, soon returning to the riverbank and more impressive old growth. At 5.5 miles arrive at a junction. Big Log Camp is to your left, a great place to while away the afternoon by the river.<br><br>Flapjack Lakes: For Flapjack Lakes, head right, climbing out of the valley. After a few switchbacks, the trail turns north, skirting a slope and gradually gaining elevation. At 5.5 miles, cross Madeline Creek. Skirt another hillside and then work your way up the Donahue Creek ravine. The way, now considerably steeper, parallels the cascading creek. At 7 miles the climb eases and you reach a junction with the trail that heads to Black and White Lakes and Smith Lake.<br><br>Continue right and after 0.5 mile reach the two Flapjack Lakes (elev. 3900 ft). Ringed by subalpine forest and framed by the rugged spires of the Sawtooth Range, the lakes serve up a hearty helping of views.

Floods in December of 2007 washed away much of the open river bank here. Contemplate the forces of nature while you assess the damage to this favorite spot of many a day tripper and over-nighter alike. <br><br>If you have any energy left, continue along the trail for another 0.75 mile to an incredible overlook of the river on a bluff high above a big bend.<br><br>Note from WTA user: If you should consider hiking beyond the scenic overlook to the ford across the river at ~9.0 miles be prepared for serious bushwacking.

The O&apos;Neil Party was intent on traversing the Olympic Peninsula. Lacking the wonderful trails that now grace the region, O&apos;Neil and company cut a mule trail up the North Fork Skokomish River to help transport supplies to base camps along the way. Among the many findings that this expedition would report was a realization that this wild area deserved to be protected.

Next, pass through a forest of silver and charred snags, thanks to a wildfire created by a careless camper in the late 1980s. New greenery is growing in, so the views of Mount Lincoln rising over the valley won&apos;t be around much longer.<br><br>Emerging back in mature forest, the trail follows alongside a much calmer river. At 2 miles the trail drops down to Four Stream, which for most of the year is too high, cold, and fast to ford.

With tight switchbacks to no switchbacks, the grade is brutal. Then once you stop climbing, you get to traverse a brushy avalanche chute. When you arrive at Wagonwheel Lake, you realize it&apos;s no chrome hubcap-just a tiny forest-ringed pond with nary a good place to soak your feet. But if you can muster some energy to climb the open ridge behind it, this hike goes to four stars, and all that sweat and pain will be worth it.<br><br>Despite its grueling statistics, little Wagonwheel Lake gets its fair share of visitors. Rather, its attempted share. Many hikers comprehend 2.9 miles, but not 3200 vertical feet. It&apos;s an insane combination, bringing many an unconditioned hiker to his knees and back to the trailhead unfulfilled. If you&apos;re ready for the challenge, however, carry on!<br><br>Through a lush understory of shoulder-high ferns and salal, ease into the climb. After about 0.25 mile, break out onto a dry ledge and get down to business. Pass an old mining bore on your right (which is more interesting than an old boring miner). Relentlessly, the trail attacks the steep slope in a series of short, tight switchbacks. Through mostly second-growth fir, a few white pines and rhododendrons break the monotony of the forest. The monotony of the climb however, is rarely broken. At about 1.5 miles, nearby a small ledge with a limited view of the valley, enter a cooler forest of hemlock.<br><br>The trail now gets even steeper-gone are the switchbacks. Hikers like me who grew up scaling the peaks of the Northeast will feel right at home. We&apos;ll also be reminded of how much we don&apos;t miss those straight-up-the-mountain trails. After 2 miles and 2 quarts of sweat, the trail miraculously levels out. Now through old-growth fir and hemlock, skirt a steep slope, breaking out onto a brushy avalanche chute. Work your way across slumping tread, enjoying views of Mount Lincoln and the Sawtooth Range.<br><br>Reenter cool evergreen forest, cross Wagonwheel&apos;s outlet creek, and finally-at 2.9 miles-arrive at the little tarn. A small sunny bench above the lake makes for a good place to collapse. But if you have any oomph left, locate a primitive path taking off from the main trail at the lake. It goes for 0.5 mile straight up the 4700-foot ridge to the north. From its meadows punctuated with silver snags, enjoy a breathtaking panorama that includes the following peaks: Pershing, Washington, Ellinor, Copper, Lincoln, Skokomish, and The Brothers. Even little Wagonwheel looks great from up here.\n                 ",

To condition yourself for long miles with significant elevation changes, to experience the difficulty of the Cascade Crest Trail before there was a Kendall Katwalk, or just to see new views.<br><br>Begin by hiking to Snow Lake. Continue past the camps on the east side of the lake, and at 3.3 miles and 4100 feet, encounter a junction with signs to Gem Lake (left) and Middle Fork Road (right). Go right, on what is more accurately the Rock Creek Trail. The trail quickly narrows and becomes rockier, while puddles and squishy mudholes may linger even in dry weather. The trail drops steadily and steeply across talus and through forest for 3.5 miles and almost 3400 feet. Along the way is a seldom-seen view of Rock Creek, tumbling down a lengthy rock face after its exit from Snow Lake.<br><br>At 6.8 miles, arrive at a junction with the Middle Fork Trail #1003 and take a right. This section of trail follows an old road, gaining less than 150 feet of elevation over the next three miles.  Water is available between miles seven and eight of your hike, but note that this may be the last easily available water for several miles. Camping is possible near Thunder Creek at 7.8 miles.<br><br>The key to successfully completing hike is finding the faint, unsigned trail that leaves the Middle Fork Trail for Red Pass.  Nine miles into your hike, you&apos;ll find a prominent three-log crossing of Burntboot Creek, which leads to Goldmyer Hot Springs property.  As you stand facing this crossing, a tree behind you is signed for &#x201C;Burntboot Creek&#x201D;. To your right is what appears to be a faint trail along the top of a large log that is nearly rotted away. This is the trail you will follow to Red Mountain. It meanders along the creek, then drifts away. At 400 feet from the Burntboot sign is proof that you are on the right trail: two signs on a tree: one forbidding bicycles and the other reading &#x201C;Trail not maintained beyond this point&#x201D;.<br><br>Using route-finding skills, follow the trail as it climbs moderately steeply through lovely old growth forest. Negotiate switchbacks and a few blowdowns as  you gain 3500 feet in just over 4.5 miles. Enjoy the shade for the first two miles, then break out into views seldom seen.<br><br>At 12 miles from the Snow Lake trailhead, crest over a small pass to an intimidating view of the steep chute leading up to Red Pass. When the snow is melted, switchbacks make this an easy ascent. Earlier, crampons and ice axe may be needed, and a real avalanche danger exists. Know conditions before you go and don&apos;t be afraid to turn around if conditions become dangerous.<br><br>At Red Pass, located at 12.4 miles and 5337 feet, climb left along the ridge top to remain on the Red Pass - Commonwealth Basin Trail. Follow the rocky trail down to the plateau holding Red Pond, then left. Drop to 3875 feet, where your next water stop is available, just under 14 miles from your starting point.<br><br>At 14.3 miles, go right, where a broken sign on a tree reads &#x201C;Abandoned&#x201D;. At 14.5 miles, rock-hop or ford Commonwealth Creek, then cross again on a log bridge at 14.7 miles. At 14.9 miles, take the short side trail to a worthwhile view of a waterfall. Continue down the narrow and brushy trail to connect with the Pacific Crest Trail, then go right the final 100 yards to arrive at the Snoqualmie Pass trailhead.

The route begins by heading to Source Lake (Route 49), but pushes on past that easy-to-reach day-hiking destination and climbs steeply to crest the saddle separating Snow Lake from the Snoqualmie River drainage. This makes for a rigorous outing, but one well worth the effort--especially for those seeking a winter camping destination.<br><br>From Alpental, follow the route to Source Lake (Route 49), staying on the west side of the river basin.

Stop and catch your breath here as you peer out at the surrounding glory. Denny Peak lies to the south, flanked by The Tooth, Bryant Peak, and Chair Peak to the west.

The waters of this lake run down the Snoqualmie River, flowing alongside Interstate 90 to North Bend, then carving north into the fertile Snoqualmie Valley before merging with the Skykomish River to form the fish-rich Snohomish River. But that&apos;s downstream. We are looking for the headwaters here. <br><br>When planning a trip along this route, be aware that when snow is unstable, avalanche dangers are scary. But when avalanche danger is listed as moderate or lower, the trail to Source Lake makes a wonderful outing for snowshoers. Snowshoers can bask in glorious views of Denny Mountain, The Tooth, Bryant Peak, Chair Peak, and Snoqualmie Mountain. Those with sharp eyes can sometimes spot radical extreme skiers sneaking away from the Alpental Ski Area to launch themselves down the near-vertical snow-laden slopes of these peaks. Those who would rather watch a more natural variety of wildlife can scan the skies to spot red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, ravens, and falcons. Martens, hares, weasels, and squirrels burrow through and scamper over the snow around the trail.<br><br>When snow levels are low, you can begin the snowshoe trek by either finding the Snow Lake trailhead on the east side of the lower parking lot and following it as it climbs up the slope before looping northwest on a level traverse for 0.5 mile to Source Lake; or go the easier route and, from the upper end of the parking area, snowshoe cross-country up the slope at the base of Snoqualmie Mountain to catch the trail as it passes the ski area. By midwinter when the snows are deep and the brush all well buried, ignore the summer trail and instead head northwest from the ski area, staying on the west side of the river basin. Don&apos;t walk in the bottom of the valley--there is a danger of punching through snow and taking a dip in the creek. Rather, stay up above the river course, but stay parallel to it. <br><br>The route climbs at a gentle pitch up the Snoqualmie River valley, passing through alder thickets, old stands of forest, and open meadows, for a bit more than 1 mile--gaining more than 700 feet along the way--before a final steep pitch of several hundred yards to the lake.<br><br>The lake is a small, circular tarn at the base of a steep wall below Chair Peak. This is the headwaters of the South Fork Snoqualmie River, although in winter, with its thick ice cap, it looks more like a flat bench than a deep lake.

Its translucent depths, tucked underneath the uppermost 2,000 feet of Chair Peak, are removed from the highway crossing Snoqualmie Pass by just a short trail with minimal elevation gain. Elitists need not apply &#x2013; Snow Lake is the most visited lake in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness&#x2026;and rightly so.<br><br>The trail departs from the north end of the main parking lot of the Alpental Ski Area, which on any given Saturday or Sunday will fill to capacity. Go early or prepare to be friendly! After an initial 200-foot climb up log steps, the trail settles down for a gradual ascent in forest. A mile in, a talus slope offers a break in the trees and views of a landscape that has suddenly grown exponentially more rugged than the parking lot you just left. In the distance, Chair Peak stands tall at the end of a jagged ridge rising over the far side of the valley.<br><br>In another three quarters of a mile, the trail switchbacks to the right &#x2013; it&#x2019;s time to start the mercifully short climb. Over the next two thirds of a mile, the trail weaves its way 500 feet up to the wilderness boundary at a saddle above Snow Lake. <br><br>Here you get your first view of your objective. From this angle, it looks unassuming enough &#x2013; its far shore is mostly rolling hills; but the first rule of Snow Lake is to never settle for the early view. It gets better &#x2013; much better. <br><br>Half a mile from the saddle--and a 400-foot drop in elevation you&#x2019;ll have to regain on the way back out--the trail reaches an inlet to the lake. Here, a short side trail leads down to the shore, passing the remains of an old cabin, a relic of a time when this part of the shore was private land. Marvel for a moment that Snow Lake was once someone&#x2019;s front yard, then wander down to the lakeside to enjoy the prior owner&#x2019;s daily view. <br><br>And a nice view it is, of Roosevelt Peak standing out at the head of the lake. Unbeknownst to the many who call it a day here, more spectacular terrain lies just out of sight beyond the shoulder of Chair Peak. Rejoin the trail, cross the inlet, and continue another half of a mile to where the lake&#x2019;s outlet drains to the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Valley. Along the way, peer deep into the clear, cold water. The depths of the lake are almost as impressive as the ramparts of the neighboring mountains soaring above you.<br><br>Just after crossing the outlet, the trail proceeds down to the lakeshore. From here, the full majesty of Chair Peak is coaxed from hiding. Sheer cliffs, crowned by polished rock rise from the distant shore. From the mountain&#x2019;s heights, waterfalls snake their way down to sheltered coves often striped by ribbons of snow until well into July--the lake&#x2019;s name is no accident. <br><br>If you can tear yourself away, you will quickly reach the end of the trail, which is no end at all but rather an intersection with two other trails. One leads a long way down to the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Valley, the upper reaches of which are visible in the distance. The other leads to yet more mountain lakes. <br><br>While there may be yet more views to be had, you can safely turn around here, secure in the knowledge that the reward for the effort will be no greater than what you have already attained.

The first 5 miles are on well maintained trail passing through old growth with areas of blueberries and salmon berries.

Use cau-tion and cross the river on it to the Campbell Tree Grove, one of the loveliest stands of old growth in the Olympics. Rest up and enjoy the return wade!</p>\n                 ",

From this 4000-plus-foot aerie above the saturated Quinault Valley, stare down upon sprawling rain forest. Enjoy an unobstructed view of shimmering Lake Quinault too, and from Mount Olympus to the Pacific take in an ocean of peaks and peek at the ocean. It&apos;s a tough climb to this rugged outpost on the periphery of the Olympics, but the panorama it provides is a worthy pursuit.<br><br>The hike to this peak is just like the man it was named for: straightforward and to the point. Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll was a Civil War veteran, politician, orator, and free thinker who never stepped foot on this peak, but some admiring climbers who did thought the peak should be named for him. The good colonel eventually got a wilderness area named after him too, the only wilderness on the west side of the Olympic National Forest.<br><br>It&apos;s just over 4 miles to the summit, but it&apos;ll feel a lot longer. Most of the way is steep, with several rocky sections. Is it worth it? Absolutely! Colonel Bob offers views into country rarely seen from high above. It&apos;s one of the very few hiker-accessible summits in the western reaches of the Olympics.<br><br>Start your journey on the Petes Creek Trail, immediately entering ancient forest and the Colonel Bob Wilderness. In just under a mile cross the creek. You may get your feet wet, you may not; some years the creek runs underground. The climb stiffens as the trail works its way up the west slope of neighboring Gibson Peak.<br><br>At 1.5 miles traverse a brushy avalanche slope. Another larger slope is encountered soon afterward and views open up of the Humptulips Valley. Steeply zigzag through rugged terrain and at 2.4 miles come to a junction with the Colonel Bob Trail (elev. 3000 ft). Head right, climbing yet more steep brush-choked slopes and finally receiving a reprieve at a gap (elev. 3700 ft) above Fletcher Canyon.<br><br>The trail now heads northwest, dropping a bit to a tarn-boulder- and creek-graced Moonshine Flats. One mile and 1000 feet of elevation gain still need to be covered. Through subalpine forest and skirting basalt cliffs, the rough trail steeply switchbacks to the summit cone, the final 100 feet on steps blasted into the rock.<br><br>One look from this former fire lookout site quickly validates all your pain and suffering. Lake Quinault twinkles below. Mount Olympus glistens to the north, while Mount Rainier hovers in the east over rows of scrappy hills and ridges. And fanning out below from your aerie hub is an emerald network of luxuriant rainforest valleys-a burgeoning kingdom of biomass.</p>\n                 ",

A half mile farther you&apos;ll reach another junction. The trail to your right travels 1.7 miles and climbs over 1000 feet to the Willaby Creek giant cedar. A ford over Willaby Creek is necessary and can be difficult in high water.<br><br>The loop continues forward to a cedar bog bursting with pungent patches of skunk cabbage. Traverse this saturated landscape via a boardwalk and come to another junction at 1.8 miles. The trail to your left heads 0.6 mile to the Quinault Lodge; proceed right instead. Cross Falls Creek, and after 0.5 mile of gentle climbing, cross Cascade Creek at lovely Cascade Falls. Admire the tumbling waters and then carry on. At 2.4 miles turn left at a junction (the right trail goes to Gatton Creek).

Close the loop by following the lakeshore for 1 mile, passing quiet coves, humble cabins, and the majestic 1926 Lake Quinault Lodge. In times of heavy rainfall, this section of trail is prone to inundation. If that&apos;s the case, return via the South Shore Road, or head up the Lodge Trail and retrace some of your route.

Reach a summit with views toward the north, from Mount Si to Mailbox Peak, and several other peaks in between. Some hikers judge Cedar Butte to be a better viewpoint than the much-visited West Tiger #3 summit, and it requires less effort and has smaller crowds, so when you are ready for a change of scene check it out.<br><br>From the parking area, walk past the privies and informational bulletin boards, and follow signs to the John Wayne Pioneer Trail / Iron Horse State Park. The former railroad grade is wide and graveled, and gets some traffic from mountain bikers. The first part of the trail borders the Cedar River Watershed (a City of Seattle drinking water source,) and frequent signs threaten dire consequences to any who trespass there. In a similar tone, pet owners are alerted that the leash law is strictly enforced ($87 fine.)<br><br>In less than a mile from the trailhead, cross Boxley Creek on a bridge edged with heavy wire mesh siding. About 100 feet beyond the bridge, a wide area on the right looks like it could lead to a trail, but that&apos;s not it. Continue on another 200 yards and find the signed Cedar Butte Trail on the right. The Green Trails map 205S (2004 edition) indicates this is Department of Natural Resources Land, but the sign at the beginning of the trail says it is part of Olallie State Park. (Perhaps state agency boundaries have changed.)<br><br>Follow the Cedar Butte Trail uphill and, in about 0.3 miles, come to an unsigned trail fork. Both branches lead to Cedar Butte, but the left fork is more direct. The right fork is about a half-mile longer, and detours past the site of the &quot;Boxley Blowout,&quot; a 1918 power dam failure that destroyed the logging community of Edgewick, with no fatalities. For more information, see the History Link site:<br><br>  http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=2426<br><br>Only the left branch of the Cedar Butte Trail is shown on the Green Trails Map. The two branches reconnect at the signed Saddle Junction, and the trail continues on, via several switchbacks, toward the summit. Near the top, you might get a glimpse of Rattlesnake Lake through the trees.<br><br>On the final approach to the summit, the trail narrows and follows along the upper edge of the steep north face of Cedar Butte. At the summit there are two very low log seats, and a USGS Bench Mark from 1937 stamped with the imaginative spelling &quot;Ceder Butt.&quot;<br><br>The summit is forested, but there are views out toward the north looking up the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River, with Mount Si, Mount Teneriffe, Green Mountain, Russian Butte and Mailbox Peak all visible.<br><br>When you are ready to descend, note a small sign with an arrow that points out an alternative trail. It avoids the narrow section along the steep north face of the butte, and soon rejoins the main trail. (But, unless the upcoming trail is crowded, this is just an option, and you might as well descend the main trail.) <br><br>Return to the trailhead the way you came or, if you feel like exploring when you get back to Saddle Junction, consider taking the trail branch you did not arrive on.</p>\n                 ",

The grade is tolerable and relatively consistent, though the tread is rocky. Enjoy a recovering forest of alder, Douglas fir, and western hemlock as you ascend, and try not to step on Pacific banana slugs, European black and brown slugs, and yellow spotted millipedes that cross this trail. There are two creek crossings, the second of which is more significant. It is 0.8 miles from the trailhead and requires one or two careful steps over a single-track log bridge. As you make your way, look for logging artifacts, especially rusty old cables.<br><br>2.8 miles from your car, you will reach a subtle intersection where the main trail turns sharply left, a fainter spur trail goes to the right, and a large cairn is piled around a small tree. An old, rusty oil can formerly marked this spot, but regrettably it has been pilfered. If you do see any artifacts along this trail, please leave them for the next hikers to enjoy. <br><br>Take the spur to the right. Follow it 0.2 miles through the forest. Near its terminus, it climbs over rock formations (no significant scrambling here) and deposits you onto a rocky balcony almost 1300 feet above I-90. Opposite you, from east to west, are Mount Kent, McClellan Butte with its famous rocky horn, and Mount Washington. Bandera Mountain is to the east. Take care near the edge, as this balcony does not have rails, and the drop-off is profound.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Dirty Harry&#x2019;s Balcony is an excellent winter hike, with the trail largely snow-free or easily passable in winter.</p>\n                 ",

Just 0.5 miles later, the unmarked trail to Mount Washington dips briefly between two large alders and begins its brutal ascent.<br><br>At 5.5 miles, reach the first of two towering trestles over Change and Hall Creeks.

These human creepy crawlers can be found hanging from their fingertips all along the rocky walls towering over the Iron Horse Trail near the Change Creek canyon. Of course, rock walls draw more than vertically oriented humans. An assortment of birds call these cliff faces home as well--swallows and swifts, hawks and falcons. Indeed, some of the most exciting wildlife moments come from swallows diving and swirling around the heads of climbers (who frequently will suck up close to the wall to avoid the &quot;bombs&quot; dropped by these small flyers).<br><br><br>No multiday assaults on multipitch, big-wall routes here. The most common form of climbing you&apos;ll see is actually bouldering, or climbing &quot;low.&quot; In bouldering, climbers stick to the rock and seldom get more than 10 feet off the flat ground. Instead, they&apos;ll plaster themselves onto the rock face, then traverse along it, staying a few feet above the ground. It&apos;s a great sport to watch, and a great way to practice climbing without fear of falling from heights.<br><br>The trail follows Change Creek, climbing steeply from the road to the Iron Horse Trail. Once on the Iron Horse, you&apos;ll immediately be in the midst of the climbing world. Before you is the Change Creek Wall. This tall face is usually streaked with white chalk scuffs, and on close inspection you&apos;ll see it is marred by countless steel bolts--climbers have drilled the wall and installed these permanent anchors through which they clip their ropes. The bolts improve safety, but are somewhat controversial among climbers, since they turn natural rock into gymlike, man-made climbing routes.<br><br>Still, hikers will barely notice the bolts (unless you hear a purist climber howl in protest). Hike east to cross Change Creek on a rustic trestle for views out over the South Fork Snoqualmie (I-90) Valley. After visiting the trestle, head back west and continue past the trail you came up on to explore the base of several climbing walls along this short 0.5-mile stretch of trail as well as views down into Olallie State Park.\n                 ",

However, as you leave the loop, the elevation gain leaves no uncertainty that you are headed in the correct direction--up. <br><br>Hike carefully in snow, because the trail is steep and tends to be icy. Traction devices like crampons are highly recommended. Ascend 2.4 steep miles at a grade of 1000 feet per mile, switchbacking up the mountain through mountain hemlock and ultimately fir forest.

Learn more about the project here - http://www.wta.org/middleforkupdates<br><br>The old route up Mailbox Peak holds a special place among the peaks along I-90. It has traditionally been a rough climber&#x2019;s trail, an unrelentingly steep, rooted, rocky, muddy torture test, a crucible in which the summits of summer are forged. More than almost any other trail, it assaults gravity with single-minded determination, proceeding more or less due east straight up a ridge line to the summit, gaining some 3,800 feet in two and a half miles after an initial short jaunt up a DNR road. There is nary a switchback in sight. <br><br>This makes it an attractive, but treacherous, prize for hikers. Scarcely a year goes by that some hapless party doesn&#x2019;t get lost here, despite the white reflectors that mark the trail. For this reason (and to bring a halt to the horrible erosion associated with the existing trail), the Department of Natural Resources has been building a new trail, on the north side of the peak. This new route, scheduled for completion in 2014, will wend its way to the top in a relatively civilized five miles, though nothing can diminish the elevation gain between the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road and Mailbox&#x2019;s 4,800-foot summit. <br><br>For those still looking for the brutal ascent to the summit, start up the gated road, bypassing the inviting new trail  about a hundred feet past the gate, on the left. Roughly a third of a mile from the gate, turn left into the woods. A sign with warnings about the difficulty of the trail (it&apos;s not exaggerating) marks your point of departure. The next fifth of a mile is relatively gentle and scenic, traveling along a runoff stream in tall forest. <br><br>And then things get steep. The trail starts climbing and doesn&#x2019;t stop - a very brief flat section in a third of a mile is a very momentary aberration. In fact, the trail grows steeper and steeper over the next half mile until it is pitching upwards at its steepest angle. Though it may not get any steeper from here, it hardly lets up. Along the way, there are few landmarks to mark your progress, just slight changes in the surroundings. In 0.15 miles, the trail crosses into dark, dense new forest &#x2013; the least scenic stretch of trail. In 0.15 miles more, the trail starts traveling over exposed roots that are incredibly slippery when wet (which is often). After a third of a mile of these root ladders, break out into the open for the first time. In a quarter mile, the trail heads back into the trees to the north, avoiding an open talus slope to your right. When snow blankets the trail, an unofficial route heads directly over the rocks, but in summer, avoid these rocks. In another fifth of a mile, the trail joins the open ridge for the rest of the way to the summit. On any but the nicest days, a stiff wind blowing from right to left will be your constant companion from here on. <br><br>Mailbox is not known for its scenery, but the terrain is not without its rewards. From the first talus slope all the way to the top is proper wilderness, forested with old gnarled trees that have survived the harsh winds of many a winter. On a nice day, the views from the summit are as good as any along I-90. Mailbox stands at the prow of a long ridge, giving it greater prominence &#x2013; ubiquitous Mount Rainier seems even closer than it does from Bandera or Granite. In early summer, the final half mile is covered in beargrass, lupine, and Indian paintbrush, as well as several other varieties of wildflowers. In winter, every tree, rock and blade of grass along the summit ridge will often be spectacularly rimed with windblown snow and ice. <br><br>The greatest reward, however, is merely the joy of the effort itself, of digging deep within yourself to summon the strength to conquer the mighty Mailbox and inscribe your name in the summit register contained &#x2013; appropriately enough &#x2013; in a mailbox someone installed at the top.</p>\n                 ",

The entry for the OLD trail can be found here: https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mailbox-peak-old-trail/<br><br>This hike will have limited access during the three-year Middle Fork Road paving project (summers 2014-2016). Learn more about the project here - http://www.wta.org/middleforkupdates<br><br>The old trail up Mailbox Peak was the stuff of legend. It inspired potential Rainier climbers, challenged adventurous day hikers, and occasionally Mother Nature used the trail to bite back. The number of injuries and rescues on the old trail, as well as terrible erosion caused by the masses of daily visitors, prompted the Department of Natural Resources to create a new trail to the top. While still relatively steep, this new route, built in part by WTA volunteers, offers a safer way for folks to attain the summit of this formidable peak. <br><br>Your trip begins along the Middle Fork Road. The hike is wildly popular--on a typical weekend, the trailhead can have upward of 50 cars at any given hour. The new trail also came with a new upper parking lot, but even so, don&apos;t expect to get a spot in the parking lot unless you arrive very early. <br><br>Hang your Discover Pass in your car and head out, walking for a short jaunt along a paved DNR road. Approach a gate and slip around it. About one hundred yards past the gate, an inviting opening indicates the location of the new trail. Set out for the summit here, along a trail that switchbacks along the northwest face Mailbox Peak. <br><br>Bridges and creek crossings await you in the lower section of the hike, and then the switchbacks start. At roughly 850 of elevation gain per mile, your thighs will feel the burn once you start climbing, and it won&apos;t let up until you&apos;re standing triumphantly next to the Mailbox. Distract yourself by taking a look at the construction of the trail. A multitude of WTA volunteer crews worked to create rock fords and turnpikes (elevated sections of trail) that keep your feet dry as you cross many creeks. <br><br>The switchbacks continue for about 4 miles, before rejoining the old trail at elevation 3860 feet for your final push to the summit. This last push consists of 960 feet of elevation gain in half a mile--hopefully the approach warmed you up for the final assault! If your energy flags, remember what views await you at the summit. <br><br>The peak&apos;s position at the end of a long ridgeline means you&apos;ll have an even better vantage point for panoramas than you might on other summits like Granite or Bandera. Rainier is in your face, and to the northwest, the Middle Fork Valley stretches before you like a lush green carpet. If nothing else, think about what might be in the mailbox itself besides the summit register. Folks have found beer, toys, even a fire hydrant at the top! What might you find? Let us know in the trip reports.</p>\n                 ",

The trail to the lake is one of the more popular hiking pathways on the east side of Snoqualmie Pass, with its diversity of uses and wildlife. It is enjoyable for campers, hikers, and birders. Climbers use it as a staging area for tackling Big Summit Chief and Chimney Rock.<br><br>From the parking area the trail heads northwest into the forest, at times hugging the Cooper River. Pass under towering old growth western white pine, Douglas fir, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, and Engelmann spruce&#x2014;you may need to check cones to tell who&#x2019;s who! The trail has a mild amount of up-and-down, some of which results from crossing eight easily-forded creeks. Pack animals walk this trail, too, so watch your steps.<br><br>The trail&#x2019;s grade and direction are consistent; 4.5 miles from and 400 feet higher than your starting point, bootpaths diverge and reach out to campsites at the shore of the lake. Along the way and at the lake, you may notice hummingbirds, common mergansers, pine siskins, evening grosbeaks, fishers, and martens. Deer, bobcats, coyotes, and cougar prowl this area. Also be cautious for wildflower overload: the list includes but is not limited to oxeye daisy, lupine, paintbrush, fireweed, Columbia lily, thimbleberry, salmonberry, candyflower, Queen Anne&#x2019;s lace, buttercup, heartleaf arnica, western columbine, queen&#x2019;s cup, and bunchberry dogwood.<br><br>When you reach the lake, which sits in a broad basin, apply your bug spray, for the mosquitoes love this lake, too. Watch the birds, photograph the flowers, or take a swim in the shallow waters.

Watch in awe as the churning, tumbling Upper South Fork Skokomish crashes and squeezes through a narrow box canyon. And while the Upper South Fork lacks federal wilderness protection, this area is nothing but pure Olympic wilderness.<br><br>From the large parking area the Upper South Fork Skokomish River Trail heads north and the Lower South Fork Trail takes off south. Though the lower trail is not a bad option, make sure you&apos;re on the Upper South Fork path. Start by hiking 0.5 mile on a grassy old roadbed to a small clearing that once served as the trailhead. Once on bonafide trail enter a world dominated by a turbulent river and towering conifers.<br><br>In 0.75 mile you&apos;ll emerge on a narrow shelf, river thundering but nowhere in view. Carefully creep to the edge of the trail and peer straight down. Directly below you the South Fork careens through a tight chasm, its booming waters occasionally interrupted by the high-pitched call of a rapids-loving dipper.<br><br>At 1.2 miles cross Rule Creek on a big log bridge. Shortly afterward span the South Fork on another big log bridge. Climbing above the tumultuous waterway, weave through a procession of old-growth giants that&apos;ll leave your neck sore from constantly cocking it upward. Why this area lacks wilderness protection is, as you can now attest, not for lack of qualifying criteria. During the free-for-all logging frenzy of the 1970s and &apos;80s, Big Timber had their axes trained on these beauties. When you return home, log a request to your senators about giving these arboreal elders some much deserved respect by permanently protecting them.<br><br>Cross numerous side streams (plan on wet feet in early season) before recrossing the South Fork at 2.25 miles. As of 2009 the washed-out bridge here has not been replaced. Use extreme caution fording if you choose to continue. The gravel bars here make for a good lounging area. Continue up the valley through mossy glens and tranquil flats, and right alongside the ever-impressive river. At about 3.25 miles the trail pulls away from the river and begins climbing. The tread gets rockier and brushier. At 4 miles you&apos;ll come to Startup Creek. A good spot to turn around-beyond, the trail deteriorates to not much more than a way path on its rugged journey to Sundown Pass in Olympic National Park.

A sprawling, lush, near-level lawn cradled by lumpy forested ridges, Camas Meadows is a geographical anomaly in the Cascades&apos; dry extreme eastern reaches. Too fragile to explore, the meadows are best viewed from above, as experienced on this hike. Magical in spring, brilliant in fall, and quiet in winter, it&apos;s not a bad place to be in summer either.<br><br>Administered by the Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR), 1300-acre Camas Meadows is one of forty-nine Natural Area Preserves in the state. These areas are managed to protect high-quality examples of the state&apos;s native ecosystems and unique and rare plant and animal communities, so recreation in the preserves is extremely limited. The majority of the Camas Meadows Preserve consists of lush, fragile wetlands that sport healthy populations of its namesake as well as the Wenatchee Mountains checkermallow and the Wenatchee larkspur, which are found nowhere else in the world.<br><br>From behind the preserve sign, walk a short distance to the edge of the meadows to see this special environment. Flowering camas speckle the verdant meadows purple in May and June. Do not venture out upon the meadows, lest you risk damaging this fragile ecosystem. Field trips into the meadows, however, are periodically conducted by a DNR plant ecologist. Con-tact the agency about attending one of these open-to-the-public events. In the meantime, hiking to a view of the meadows from above is in order. And it&apos;s earth-friendly!<br><br>Following a series of old logging roads, this hike begins from behind a yellow gate. Walk along wetlands surrounded by aspen groves and stands of pine and fir. After 0.5 mile of easy walking, come to a junction (elev. 2950 ft). Take the road right and immediately come to another junction. Bear right again, following the less-defined road. Walk grassy tread, gently climbing, and after 0.5 mile come to a ridge crest replete with views!<br><br>Look west to the Stuart Range and Three Brothers; north over penstemon-packed ledges to the Peshastin Pinnacles, Burch, Chumstick, and the rest of the Entiat gang. Then fix your eyes south down upon Camas Meadows, set against a backdrop of Mission Ridge, Mount Lillian, and Red Hill. Admire the meadow&apos;s aspen islands. Come October, they add brilliant golden touches to the verdant vale.\n                 ",

Enjoy this largely forgotten trail and you&apos;ll be able to selfishly soak in those views without having to share.<br><br>Start up the trail as it parallels De Roux Creek heading west. After nearly 1 mile of forest hiking, the trail forks. Go left to leave De Roux Creek and start a steep climb out of the valley (the right fork goes to Hike 92, Esmerelda Basin). You&apos;ll soon be sweating as you ascend switchbacks for just over 0.5 mile to a 5040-foot pass on the shoulder of Koppen Mountain. You&apos;ll find fine views here, but don&apos;t stop now - the scenery and the views get better as you go higher.<br><br>At the pass the trail splits. Follow the wide boot-beaten path to the left as it climbs the north shoulder of Koppen Mountain. This trail was actually built before World War II when Koppen was home to a fire lookout station. Since the trail was built for fire spotters rather than recreationists, it tends to be steep and straight - these men truly believed that the fastest way from point A to point B was a straight line, even if that line ran vertically! Fortunately, the slope isn&apos;t to steep, and the trail is enjoyable.<br><br>The path rolls upward through grassy meadows to the open summit of Koppen Mountain (elev. 6031 ft), about 3.5 miles from the trailhead. Drop your pack and lie down in the cool grass. Look skyward to watch the resident raptors soar on the afternoon thermals. Look to the north to gawk at towering Mount Stuart beyond Iron Peak.

Bean Creek is one of those trails affording views of the spectacular rock slabs of Stuart. But there&apos;s more to this trail than mountain views. Indeed, there are splendid views of Ingalls Peak and other summits in the Stuart Range. But it&apos;s the little things that make Bean Creek special. A plethora of blooming plants--wildflowers of all varieties--grace the valley. And an army of wild critters calls the basin home, from mule deer to deer mice, from gray jays to pileated woodpeckers.<br><br>Cross Beverly Creek on the stout bridge near the trailhead and climb creekside on an old, overgrown roadbed. At 0.5 mile turn right at the first trail junction and start up Bean Creek valley. The trail drives upward through the tight valley, lined lightly with trees and carpeted with beargrass, buckwheat, and other blooming plants under the waving branches of the pines and firs.<br><br>Many of the trees that used to dot the hillsides can be seen rotting in piles at the bottom of the steep valley--dropped by a violent avalanche some years before. The trail continues a steep climb for nearly a mile, crossing the creek to access more cool forest and small forest meadows higher up the valley. The creek can be fast and tough to wade early in the year when melting snows swell the flow.<br><br>At 2 miles the trail leaves a stand of forest and erupts onto a broad swath of green, speckled with reds, blues, purples, yellows, and whites--that is, a vast grassy meadow filled with the odoriferous heads of blooming wildflowers.<br><br>At this point the trail forks. Stay left to climb into the flower fields of Bean Creek basin. The trail leads to a wonderful camp along the creek, and then angles up into a garden of color, dotted with alpine firs and stunted pines. As you ascend the 0.5-mile from this last trail junction, you&apos;ll find the meadows growing larger and the stands of trees growing smaller, until finally the meadow wins out and takes over all the basin before you. Here, at around 5300 feet, you&apos;ll be standing amid flowers that stretch across scores of acres.<br><br>Above the meadows tower the jagged tops of Earl Peak, Mount Stuart, and Iron Peak.

Great meadows stretch out all around, and on every horizon stand picture-perfect mountain ranges, with the hulking presence of Mount Stuart to the north dominating all others. Enjoy these sights, but make sure you give plenty of attention to the route too, and don&apos;t be afraid to turn back and hike out the way you came if you lose the loop.<br><br><br>The trail angles northwest along Beverly Creek for 0.5 mile before the path diverges (the right is your return route).

This pass sits on the spine of the Wenatchee Mountains, below the craggy rock summit of Iron Peak. One look at the mountain&apos;s reddish hue explains the name--the iron-rich rocks have oxidized (rusted) to a russet orange.<br><br>From the pass, turn right and follow a long traverse to the east, looping around the head of Fourth Creek basin and climbing slowly to a high pass (elev. 6387 ft) between Fourth Creek and Hardscrabble Creek valleys. The trail then drops to a junction with the Hardscrabble Creek Trail at 5.1 miles from the trailhead. The trail to the left descends Hardscrabble Creek, and while it can be narrow and brushy, it is generally easy to see.<br><br>Straight ahead, though, our path plays hide and seek in the broad fields of rock and wildflowers. The trail can be hard to follow, but by maintaining an easterly heading and staying at the 5900-foot elevation, scramblers can work their way across the 2-mile stretch of trail between the Hardscrabble and the Cascade Creek Trails. Enjoy the views down into Ingalls Creek valley and across that valley to Mount Stuart and the jagged line of the Stuart Range.<br><br>Once you reach the junction with the Cascade Creek Trail at about 7.2 miles, turn right and hike south, descending into the Stafford Creek valley. After about 1 mile you&apos;ll encounter the Standup Creek Trail. Turn right once more and follow this path up and over the ridge between Stafford and Standup Creeks, and cross the pass on the flank of Earl Peak.<br><br>At 5800 feet the trail splits, about 10.5 miles from the start.

Vast meadows of lupine, shooting star, columbine, phlox, paintbrush, daisies, and buckwheat, among countless others, sprawl over the ridge tops. Topping it all off, you can expect to encounter few other folks here--not many hikers extend themselves along these trails, though horse riders love this rugged, remote route.<br><br>From the trailhead, climb the steep, switchbacking Eldorado Creek Trail through forest for the first mile. Forest gives way to clearings and then broader meadows the farther up you go.<br><br>You&apos;ll dip into the headwater basin of Eldorado Creek at just past 2 miles, then climb the valley headwall through a very tight, very rugged series of switchbacks to the high saddle (elev. 6100 ft) below Iron Peak at 3 miles. Here, from Eldorado Pass, you&apos;ll enjoy grand views north to the Stuart Range and southwest to Koppen and Malcolm Mountains.<br><br>You could end your hike at this point, after resting up and enjoying the views. Or, press on as the trail drops over the back side of the ridge and descends 500 feet over the next 0.5 mile to a junction with the Beverly-Turnpike Trail.<br><br>Turn left and climb another 0.5 mile to a second pass, Turnpike Pass, this one separating the Beverly Creek and Turnpike Creek basins. Here, the views are as good as you&apos;ll find anywhere--Ingalls Peak towers to the northwest, Mount Stuart fills the northern skyline, and the long cut of Ingalls Creek valley rolls away to the east.\n                 ",

The trail boasts over 75 varieties of wildflowers, evidence of an old mining operation, and vantage points into the Cascades from two different passes - one is unnamed, the other is Fortune Creek Pass.<br><br>The trail begins at the end of the North Fork Teanaway Road.

Continue straight and wander through trees, then meadows, cross streams, and gain elevation, making long switchbacks as you go.

The wide, old roadway eventually narrows as the trail climbs higher along the hillside. Eventually, the trail skirts the slopes of Ingalls Peak as it heads northwest. <br><br>Approximately 3 miles from the trailhead, an intersection with Trail 1226 heads north to a pass overlooking Lake Ann. Taking this trail to the overlook is worthwhile, and adds just about 2 miles to your trip and nearly 500 feet in elevation. Otherwise, continue hiking straight, staying on Trail 1394.

It is a stunning blue lake, set high in a basin beneath rocky peaks, showcasing striking Mount Stuart as its backdrop. The trail to this treasure is filled with delights, both for the summer adventurer as well as for those hikers who appreciate fall colors. Views of the craggy Esmeralda Peaks, a walk through beautiful Headlight Basin plus a pretty picture of the imposing Stuart Range are just a few of the wonders along the way.<br><br>The hike travels through a number of ecosystems which make this a unique traipse through the Teanaway Valley and into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Beginning in a forested valley decorated with a host of wildflowers and underbrush, the trail meets a junction in about 0.4 of mile, marked Ingalls Way. Turn right here; traveling straight will take you into Esmeralda Basin.<br><br>The path immediately makes its way up the hillside, soon exiting the pine trees and entering open country. At approximately 2 miles, another trail junction begs you to venture right and up to Long&#x2019;s Pass, a side trip that adds 1.4 miles round-trip to your adventure. Continue straight on the trail, gently weaving in and out of contours in the dramatic landscape on your continual climb to Ingalls Pass. <br><br>Constant views of the Esmeralda Peaks and Fortune Pass keep hikers enticed for more. As the trail nears the pass, it takes long switchbacks that flirt with rocky meadows and even better views on its way into the alpine. At about three miles, reach Ingalls Pass, where the views become vast, with Mount Stuart and the Ingalls Peaks in close proximity. The basin below to the north is filled with green, grassy meadows strewn with streams, abundant flowers, and popular alpine larches before it becomes a rocky walk and scramble to the hidden lake on the far side of the basin. It is here that one might begin counting mountain goats and other high-country wildlife.<br><br>From the pass, drop down to the meadows and follow a rocky trail around the outside edge of the basin. This stretch of trail is rough, and route-finding via cairn may be required at times, before it rounds a bend and heads up a draw into a unique and special lake basin. <br><br>The lake is a spectacular sky-blue and surrounded by rocks that fall in giant slabs into the water&#x2019;s sandy floor. Ingalls Peaks reach high above the lake on the one side, while Mount Stuart stands majestically to its northeast. There are few places as lovely as this. Follow a boot path around the far side of the lake for a different, beautiful perspective.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Be prepared on summer weekends to share this wilderness wonder with other outdoor enthusiasts. It&#x2019;s a destination that cannot be denied. In the fall, the larch trees turn an electric orange which will surely draw the eye.<br><br>**Note that dogs are not allowed at Lake Ingalls. Canine friends are allowed on the trail to Esmeralda Basin, which shares the first 0.4 miles with the trail to Lake Ingalls. However, from the junction of the Esmeralda Basin trail and the Ingalls Way trail, dogs are no longer allowed. This includes Ingalls Pass and the Longs Pass.</p>\n                 ",

The trail now begins a steady elevation gain through the forest with occasional small water crossings that are often surrounded by wildflowers taking advantage of the cool spray. You continue to gain most of the elevation for this hike over the next 1.5 miles. The trail opens up as you traverse several talus slopes offering views of Granite Mountain to the north and Humpback Mountain to the west. These open slopes are also good places to see trillium and glacier lilies coming up through the receding snow of late spring.<br><br>After the last talus slope you enter the forest for a fairly flat hike to the north shore of Annette Lake. From the lake&apos;s edge you can take in Abiel Peak to the southwest and Silver Peak to the east, as well as a waterfall descending into the lake&apos;s east shore. The camping area is just a short walk to the east.<br><br>If you have the time or energy, explore the Asahel Curtis Nature Trail when you return to the trailhead. This 0.5-mile loop is a great one for your camera. The two bridges near the beginning of the trail go over Humpback Creek as the trail leads you through moss-hung trees, swamps of giant skunk cabbage and interpretive signs.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Good places to stop for after-hike socializing and talk about your just completed hike or other adventures include the North bend Bar and Grill, 145 E. North Bend way and Stan&apos;s Barbecue in Issaquah, 58 Front Street. Both offer good after-hike food and beverages.</p>\n                 ",

But as strenuous as the well-trod summer path maybe, it&apos;s nothing compared to the snow route up the big mountain. Snowshoers don&apos;t have the benefit of the long, looping switchbacks and hillside traverses. Instead, they must climb steeply and fairly directly to the top, gaining more than 3700 feet in about 2.5 miles--or nearly 1500 feet per mile! Take your time, and watch the snow conditions as you climb.<br><br>The route begins at the summer trailhead for the Granite Mountain Trail, but you won&apos;t stick to the trail for long. The winter route climbs nearly due north, staying on the low ridgeline that climbs in a gentle westward arc toward the summit. Avoid drifting east into the obvious--and hazardous--avalanche chute there. The summer hiking trail pierces the heart of that chute, but in winter, snow flushes that valley regularly. Steer clear of it. <br><br>The safe route climbs steeply from the get-go, passing first through a tight tangle of Douglas fir and cedar trees, then breaking out into open snowfields at about 3500 feet. If you have climbed straight north, you should be nearly due south of the summit at this point. Keep mobbing upward, staying near the spine of the ridge. You might encounter bare rock on this windswept ridgeline, but keep your shoes on for traction since the snow is not gone, just blown somewhere else. <br><br>As you push up toward the summit, views open and you can enjoy spectacular panoramas to the south and east. Humpback Mountain towers due south, and Mount Catherine sits to the southeast. If you&apos;re tired and worried about getting back down before dark, skip the summit and turn around anytime after you break out of the trees.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Backcountry<br>These routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses.

All that traffic does a number on the trail itself, but fortunately WTA work parties have worked hard here, ensuring that all trail users stay on the picturesque path to Pratt Lake. <br><br>The first mile may be crowded, but after passing a junction with the popular Granite Mountain trail, the crowds disperse &#x2013; or at least spread out. Hike along the wide Pratt Lake Trail, crossing several sweet streams fed by snowbanks high up on the flanks of Granite Mountain. In early spring, these stream crossings can be high, even treacherous, so evaluate each crossing for safety according to your own ability. <br><br>Three miles in, you&#x2019;ll come to a junction. The left-hand fork leads to the Ollalie Lake Trail in just 0.2 miles, but Pratt Lake is found by taking the right-hand fork, which traverses the hillside and then begins climbing to a junction with the Island Lake/Mount Defiance Trail after 1.2 miles. Just before this junction, you&#x2019;ll reach a clear spot in the trail, where Ollalie Lake lies still and green in the valley below you, and Rainier hovers straight ahead. In this open area, beargrass flourishes in early spring. It&#x2019;s a great spot for a snack and photo opportunity. <br><br>At the junction for Island Lake, take the right hand path that heads down into Pratt Lake Basin. All the climbing you have done from the trailhead is now reversed, as you switchback steeply down a forested hillside to open granite talus slopes. Here the trail is quite exposed &#x2013; be sure to bring (and use) your sunscreen. Hike down the talus to a marshy section that sometimes requires bug juice &#x2013; mosquitos and black flies can be an irritation here, but a breeze can lessen their onslaught. <br>This marshy area opens onto yet another talus field. Stop for a moment to take in the sapphire-blue waters of Pratt Lake before pressing on. From here it&#x2019;s less than half a mile to the Pratt Lake campgrounds and day use areas.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Camping at Pratt Lake makes a great base camp for backcountry adventures, including fishing (catch-and-release), a short stroll to Lower Tuschohatchie Lake just 0.6 miles away, or a day hike to Melakwa Lake, a more demanding six-mile roundtrip hike.</p>\n                 ",

But views of pointed Kaleetan Peak, deep blue Crystal Lake, the climber-dotted Tooth, and Mount Rainier dominating the skyline to the south make it all worth it. <br><br>Begin at the Pratt Lake trailhead in cool, mossy forest, where you hike along a wide, moderately-graded tread. On the way to the junction for Granite Mountain Trail, a large switchback offers views straight up a steep, debris-filled avalanche chute. This is evidence of a real danger in the winter and early spring; hikers without avalanche gear are better off waiting until the snow has melted down before tackling Granite. <br><br>After 1.2 miles, arrive at the junction. Here the Pratt Lake trail continues on a moderate grade via the left fork, but your vertical adventure is just beginning. Granite Mountain Trail heads off to the right.<br><br>After the junction, the trail narrows and becomes rockier, so watch your step as you continue hiking through quiet forest. While it may be shady, it&apos;s unlikely you&apos;ll be chilly. The steep grade will keep you warm as you follow narrow switchbacks up, up, up. <br><br>Just under a mile from the junction, cross the avalanche chute you peered up near the beginning of the trail. A seasonal stream runs down the chute and early in the season you can replenish your water supply from it, but don&apos;t forget to filter! Continue past the chute and traverse eastward, up onto the shoulder of Granite Mountain. When you break into high meadows, the steep grade lessens. Catch your breath and scan the horizon. How many of the summits can you identify? <br><br>After orienting yourself, press on. The trail becomes increasingly rock-laden, slowing your pace as you clamber up and around large boulders. It&apos;s here that you realize just how appropriate Granite Mountain&apos;s name is. Fortunately, the views are gorgeous and huckleberry bushes line the trail. In late summer, the berries provide a rejuvenating snack. A switchback in the trail reveals the lookout that is your destination, but don&apos;t be fooled. From your first sighting of the structure it&apos;s still a mile to the summit. <br><br>The trail progresses north, with the lookout on your left. Leave the fields of huckleberries and follow the narrow, rocky trail through the bottom of a basin. Enjoy the easiest part of this hike, a jaunt through a green alpine meadow bordered by a talus slope to the south. The final push is a grunt, but the views! Break out above treeline onto a talus field, and marvel at the lookout perched on the rocks. Further afield, Mount Stuart and the Teanaway are visible to the east, Rainier commands your view to the south, and if it&apos;s a clear day, you can make out Baker floating on the northern horizon. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: The Granite Mountain Lookout can accommodate a relatively small number of people. During the summer and especially on weekends, Granite Mountain can have as many as 100 hikers at its summit, so please be courteous to fellow hikers and limit your time spent exploring the lookout if there is a ranger at the summit who has opened it to the public.</p>\n                 ",

At just 2 miles with 400 feet in elevation gain it is the perfect destination for any hiker looking for something easy and beautiful.<br><br>WTA has done trail work here for the last three years, making this trail as safe as possible for even the smallest of hikers. There are a few spots where bits of the trail have been washed out, or handrails haven&#x2019;t been installed, but overall you can feel confident in bringing your youngsters here for a safe and fun day on the trail. The trail includes a number of stairs with a very gentle incline that is easily hiked. As you hike, you&apos;ll be enshrouded in a thick canopy of coniferous trees which makes it a great trail to do on a hot day. <br><br>At .7 miles in, the trail draws parallel to National Forest Road 58 for a short time. Just .3 miles further along, you reach picturesque Franklin Falls. The falls are situated between two tall viaducts that allow traffic along I-90 to pass year-round without interference from avalanches in winter. The falls are actually comprised of three separate tiers, giving them a total drop of 135 feet. However, only the last and largest drop can be seen from the trail. At 70 feet, Franklin Falls is a spectacular sight to see, with its best flows between April and July. <br><br>There is a viewpoint before reaching the falls but hikers can get closer by following a narrow trail gouged into the side of the rock. Use caution and keep children close as the rocks are often wet and potentially slippery. The falls, when running at peak, give off a pretty heavy spray so rain gear is a good idea if you want to get close. During lower flow periods there is more room to roam by the base of the falls. In the wintertime this also makes an excellent destination for an easy snowshoe, though hikers are well-advised to not venture to the splash pool in icy conditions. The falls run year round and the incredible icicle formations along the rock face around the falls are spectacular--well worth the trip. <br><br>The parking lot can hold around 15 cars and there is overflow parking along the roadside. There is no privy at this trailhead but there are toilets at the Denny Creek Campground, just a stone&apos;s throw from the trailhead. There are no garbage receptacles at the trailhead so be sure to pack it out!<br><br>Pro Tip: Arrive early to ensure a parking spot and enjoy the trail before it becomes too crowded.</p>\n                 ",

Like its counterparts, this trail is largely for those interested in heading up, steeply. Moderated with switchbacks at times, and with a gradual traverse when you need it, the rewards here are not without effort. The actual summit is a rock-scramble, but the views and the flower-packed west facing slope near the top can be enjoyed without making the true top. More than a few remaining old-growth trees and a soft tread make this a well-rounded hike whether it is a training hike or your weekend reward. <br><br>Despite heavy logging, road building, and the old Chicago/Milwaukee railroad grade, which was decommissioned in the sixties, this trail maintains a lush character with numerous old-growth trees. The first few miles crosses power lines, the Iron Horse Trail, and Forest Service road 9020. Stick with it and power up the at-times steep trail. Peek-a-boo views of the Alice Valley and Mount Kent to the east will keep you interested. <br><br>At roughly 2.5 miles into the hike one needs to exercise caution around a series of avalanche chutes and snow bridges which can be undermined by flowing water. These snow runnels can be quite dangerous and hard-packed with snow. At this elevation, snow frequently lasts until early July so be cautious and realistic with your abilities and equipment. If there is snow, come back when it is gone, since on these steep slopes, snow can slide at any time. The trail continues to about 4 miles, where it turns west and then quickly north towards the summit ridge.<br><br>This last mile of the hike has small meadows, a vernal pond, and scrambly little rocky sections of trail. Although most will be satisfied with the views from this area, the true summit may beckon to others. Those who venture up should keep in mind: rain can make the rock slippery and although technically easy the scramble to the summit is very exposed. Watch for the steps and hand holds blasted into the ridgeline. <br><br>Views from the top encompass the full range of I-90 peaks, Snoqualmie Pass, and much of the Alpine Lake Wilderness. As you carefully descend the rocky summit, think of the pioneers who first documented these lands. General George B McClellan visited this area in 1853 surveying (unsuccessfully) for a route for rail lines to pass through the Cascades. He chose the never-used Yakima Pass. The more popular route was Snoqualmie Pass, home now to the major interstate highway you used to get to the trailhead.</p>\n                 ",

And second, a rocky steep trail that follows a waterfall and a precipitous gorge upstream to get to a pair of clear alpine lakes flanked by rocky peaks.  Is it about the journey or the destination?  You decide.<br><br>Start out from the trailhead on a wide trail that meanders through forest, with trees young and old. Due to its popularity, this part of the trail has been the focus of numerous trail maintenance outings, yet there are still rocks and roots to contend with; that&#x2019;s just the nature of the terrain.<br><br>At a half mile, freeway noise peaks as you pass under the elevated span of eastbound Interstate 90. Then at just over 1 mile is a popular natural feature known by various names: the Denny Creek Water Slide, Slide Rock, the Slippery Slab. This is the destination for many families, for frolicking and/or picnicking on a hot summer day. If this is your destination, see our hiking guide entry for Denny Creek.<br><br>At the water slide, Denny Creek is posted as &#x201C;Impassible During High Water&#x201D;. In normal flows however, strategically placed rocks offer a dry crossing. The trail re-enters pleasant forest on the opposite side, marked by a sign on a large tree that reads &#x201C;Main Trail&#x201D;. A quarter mile from the water slide, the trail passes through an area of lush vegetation then breaks out into the open, revealing two tiers of Keekwulee Falls, the main drop falling 90 feet into a steep ravine.  In the morning, the falls can be seen glinting in the sunlight.<br><br>Climb more earnestly after this point, alternating between open talus and forested shade. At 1.9 miles, hear Denny Creek echoing off the walls of its narrow gorge above Keekwulee Falls, finally drowning out freeway noise. At a couple of switchbacks, the trail offers views almost straight down for those who may want to peer down the steep walls.<br><br>At 2.25 miles, the trail levels off for 0.2 mile until it crosses gently gurgling Denny Creek on a footlog beside a huge cedar snag. The rest of the way to Hemlock Pass is steep as you alternate between talus and forest. In season, there may be few wildflowers blooming in this section. At 3.8 miles, top out at Hemlock Pass, 4600 feet. Continue the final 0.4 mile, losing 150 feet of elevation to arrive at the outlet of Melakwa Lake. A massive logjam offers one way to cross the outlet stream. Just on the other side is a popular gathering place for hikers and a signed trail to a privy. Enjoy the lake and wonder at the meaning of its name. Hint: &#x201C;Melakwa&#x201D; is Chinook for &#x201C;mosquito&#x201D;.<br><br>To get to the smaller Upper Melakwa Lake, continue 0.2 mile along the left side of the lake. Cross the stream connecting the two lakes to get to campsites on either lake, or to continue wandering, e.g. to Melakwa Pass.<br><br>On the return, remember to take the upper trail at the junction 100 feet past the logjam, to climb back up to Hemlock Pass.</p>\n                 ",

Snowshoe Falls maybe a bit elusive and more difficult to see from the trail, but is also a beautiful natural wonder.<br><br>Denny Creek was named for Arthur A. Denny, the leader of the Denny Party, some of the original settlers of Seattle, who had mining claims in the area.<br><br>As you embark on the forested Denny Creek trail you find yourself immersed in an old-growth forest. Various coniferous trees provide a magnificent canopy under which you walk along a three foot wide, somewhat rocky and rooty trail. A diverse understory of ferns, salmonberry, skunk cabbage, and numerous wildflower species surrounds you. But watch out for the rather unpleasant devil&#x2019;s club that is frequently found along the side of the trail!<br><br>WTA has been working hard to improve drainage issues on this trail with crews working here in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Evidence of this work is found in the boardwalks, crib walls, culverts, drainage ditches, and rock walls all along the trail. These structures were installed to keep the trail free of water and mud, and overall the improvements are working!<br><br>After one-half mile, reach the first crossing of Denny Creek. A large, well-built bridge allows you safe passage over the waters below. A little further up the trail, you cross under a staggeringly tall viaduct. WSDOT built this soaring structure to allow winter avalanches to pass under the freeway, keeping the way clear for I-90 traffic year-round.<br><br>Soon you&apos;ll enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and just a short while later, arrive at the next crossing of Denny Creek and the ever popular waterslide rocks, just over a mile from the trailhead. The bridge that was once here was washed out in 2009 by avalanche debris making its way down the creek during the spring melt, so water shoes are recommended to ensure a safe fording of the creek. The swift and ever-changing current and the water&apos;s frigid temperatures can be dangerous. Be sure to assess the current conditions you are faced with before deciding whether or not to cross. Water levels can rise quickly, making this a potentially dangerous crossing.<br><br>If you deem the water to be running low enough, stop here for a cool dip and a picnic on the rocks. Many people choose this as their turnaround point, which gives you an easily done day hike of about 2 miles roundtrip with 400 feet of elevation gain. <br><br>If you can, keep going up the trail an additional 0.7 miles to reach the beautiful Keekwulee Falls.  Named in 1916 by a party of mountaineers, Keekwulee is a Chinook word meaning &#x201C;to fall down&#x201D;. The falls has two drops, totaling 125 feet; the taller of the two drops is 90 feet. It&apos;s fueled by runoff and is highest between April and July. There is an outcropping of rocks just off the trail for an excellent lunch spot with an amazing viewpoint. Making this your turnaround point gives you a five mile roundtrip hike with 803 feet of elevation gain.<br><br>Snowshoe Falls is an additional one-half mile along the trail but isn&#x2019;t as scenic as Keekwulee Falls. The trail leading to a viewpoint for the falls is steeper and rockier then the trail below. The waterfall itself, while larger than Keekwulee Falls, at 150 feet, is much more difficult to see from the trail. Making this your turnaround point gives you a six-mile roundtrip hike with 1345 feet in elevation gain.<br><br>The trailhead has two privies, informative/interpretive signage, a picnic table, and garbage cans. The parking lot can accommodate about 40 cars with overflow parking along the roadside when needed.</p>\n                 ",

Most would describe it as an easy hike--relatively short and not very steep for most of its length&#x2013;-but then it suddenly changes, turning informal and rough, particularly in its last half mile, making it feel like the rugged backcountry trek it at times can be. <br><br>Start out on the Ira Spring Trail. The parking lot will likely be full if you come here on a nice weekend day. Not only is Bandera a popular hike, but it shares a trailhead with the equally popular trails to Mason Lake and Mount Defiance. For the first mile and a half, it is gentle and wide as it follows an old road bed (about halfway through this first section, a water crossing may be somewhat difficult during times of heavy runoff). The trail departs the old road and heads more steeply uphill. Occasional breaks in the trees enable partial views of Rainier to the south. <br><br>In another mile and a quarter, after a series of looping switchbacks, the trail to Bandera and the trail to Mason Lake part company as the way to Bandera heads straight uphill through a meadow of beargrass and bleached stumps of trees burned in a fire long ago. The next fifth of a mile is steep &#x2013;- in fact, one of the steepest stretches of trail you&#x2019;ll find, gaining one foot of elevation for every two feet it travels. The saving grace for those not used to this sort of climbing is that it is mercifully brief and boasts firm footing in the form of numerous rocks and boulders. <br><br>The trail soon reaches a ridge and heads east along it. At times, it becomes somewhat difficult to follow as it enters minor rock fields, until reaching Little Bandera, technically a false summit. The vast majority of people turn around here after pausing to picnic among the blocky granite and stunted firs. There is nothing false about the views-&#x2013;this spot provides an excellent vantage of the ridge and meadows to the south, as well as across I-90 to nearby peaks like McClellan Butte and the ubiquitous Rainier. Turning around here gives you a round trip hike of 7 miles, with about 2850 feet of elevation gain; perfectly respectable for a day hike. <br><br>If you must press on to the true summit, know that the trail gets hard to follow. It drops steeply over the rocks of Little Bandera&#x2019;s summit and is barely visible. You&apos;ll lose and then regain elevation as you follow the ridge. Few people venture out this way&#x2013;-Bandera Mountain&apos;s actual summit is forested and holds no real attraction save for the glory of reaching a summit less than 100 feet taller than the false summit you just stood on.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>From the Ira Spring trailhead, hike an old logging grade graced in spring with twinflowers, tiger lilies and other forest flowers. Climb steadily uphill and, in a half-mile, come to Mason Creek. Pause here to take in the view of 5162-foot McClellan Butte to the south. It will be visible for much of your hike, but it is most dramatic from this lower vantage. Once you reach the summit of 5584-foot Mount Defiance you will be over 400 feet higher than McClellan. <br><br>Mason Creek, in late spring or summer, is easily crossed on boulders or small logs. But in early spring, with snow melting rapidly above, the creek can become a torrent that may be hazardous to cross. If you are uncomfortable, consider coming back in a week or two.<br><br>Continue on the logging grade a while, then leave the grade for a steeper climb with a few switchbacks. Look for the summit dome of Mount Rainier to appear over the southern horizon and, in more open areas along the trail, be alert for Indian paintbrush and lupine. When the trail passes through a short, dark forest section you may see a few stalks of coralroot in bloom.<br><br>The trail emerges onto boulder fields, but with comfortable footing. In late spring or early summer you will be surrounded by a forest of beargrass interspersed with other flowers. Mount Defiance will be visible up ahead. Hike past the side trail to Bandera Mountain and press on toward Mason Lake. At the ridge top a memorial plaque honors Ira Spring, the well-known advocate for trails. Look for it just before descending some 200 feet toward Mason Lake. <br><br>There is more shade on the north side of the ridge and, early in the season, the trail may still be moist or even muddy in spots. At the outlet of the lake cross Mason Creek once again, this time on secure boulders, and continue on. Soon, a sign for &quot;Main Trail&quot; points up some stepping stones while a lower trail leads to possible camp sites or fishing access.<br><br>Farther along, the trail forks. There are no signs here. The left branch leads into a swampy area and, eventually, to Little Mason Lake. Unless you are exploring, try to avoid this distraction, as you still have lots of elevation to gain before reaching the summit. The right branch is your route, and in spring or early summer it too can have significant muddy spots. About 0.3 miles from the lake outlet come to a signed T-junction with the Mount Defiance Trail (#1009,) and turn left there.<br><br>The route climbs steeply up the forested, shady east slope of Mount Defiance, with a few switchbacks. The way can be quite rooty and moist, and patches of snow can linger here well into July. Footprints in the snow, left by earlier hikers, will likely be visible, and the trail itself may reappear from time to time. Later in the summer the snow will be completely gone, the footing drier and the trail clear.<br><br>The route winds around the south side of Mount Defiance where the snow disappears much earlier. After a few more switchbacks it emerges into a meadow. There, as the last of the snow is melting - perhaps in early June - a multitude of glacier lilies appears. But they are early bloomers, and to see them you may have to tolerate a few snow patches on Defiance&apos;s shady east side. As the season progresses other flowers will appear in the meadow.<br><br>The trail traverses the meadow to its west end, where an unsigned but obvious route heads steeply upslope. It&apos;s rough, but easily followed and not dangerous. Trekking poles might be helpful. After a gain of less than 400 feet you will be on the stony summit of Mount Defiance.  <br><br>Take in the views in every direction. Clouds permitting, a wide swath of summits will be visible from Mounts Adams and Rainier in the south to Mount Baker in the far north, with a host of Cascade peaks in between. Nearby, look for Granite and Bandera Mountains, and to the west look for Dirty Harry&apos;s Peak, Russian Butte, and Mount Teneriffe. The lake 1800 feet below is Lake Kulla Kulla. Often you will see sunlight glinting off ripples on its surface. Other, smaller lakes are visible too. Check your map and try to identify some of them, and perhaps identify additional peaks as well. Mount Defiance is an exceptional viewpoint for learning the layout of the surrounding terrain.<br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: On a summer afternoon, uphill hikers may find temperatures on the boulder fields uncomfortably warm. Unless it&apos;s a really cool day, consider beginning your hike at an early hour.</p>\n                 ",

Here, a number of small forested islands catch the sunlight in morning and evening, providing a relaxing panorama if you&apos;ve chosen to camp. <br><br>From the traverse on Defiance, follow the narrow, somewhat brushy trail over to the north side of Defiance Ridge. 2.6 miles of ridgeline traverse bring you to yet another backbone, where you may be able to spot Spider Lake and creek in the basin to the southeast. <br><br>But you&apos;re heading to the northwest.

At the far end of the bridge, find the entrance to the Horan Natural Area. Be sure to check out the information kiosk before proceeding. Then, on a gravel surface trail, wander along oxbow ponds bursting with birds and frogs and under rows of cottonwoods. Come to a junction where you can go left or right: it doesn&apos;t matter, it&apos;s a loop.<br><br>Along the way enjoy riparian bottomlands, river views, and glimpses out to Mission Ridge and the Sage Hills. Look for muskrats among the cattails and beavers among the willows. And throughout the Natural Area, watch for birds: warblers, kingfishers, kingbirds, towhees, quails, and scores of others.<br><br>Before closing the loop, be sure to continue on the trail that ventures south for 0.4 mile to the Apple Capital Trail. Then retrace your steps and take the loop segment you didn&apos;t choose earlier, returning back to where you began, for a nice 2.5 mile saunter.\n                 ",

The trail rolls south to north and opens up on views of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness peaks, Cle Elum Lake, and the entire eastern Cascade Mountains.<br><br>Few folks visit the north end of this trail in winter, so those snowshoers who do venture out along the route will find it empty of human company. Still, they won&apos;t be alone. A host of wintering animals thrive here, including a few who perform chameleon acts by changing into snowy white coats each winter. Snowshoe hares, ptarmigans, and weasels are seen as flashes of white against the white snow only when they move. But even their winter camouflage can&apos;t save them from the predators who prowl this area. Coyotes, bobcats, cougars, red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, falcons, and great horned owls all compete for the few small animals that scamper about the snowy forests and meadows of Sasse Ridge.<br><br>Start up FR 116 as described in Route 61, Hex Mountain. At the top of the trail, at 3.3 miles, instead of turning right for a short scramble to the summit of Hex, turn left onto the Sasse Ridge Trail and start the long, scenic snowshoe north. The trail follows the crest of the ridge for more than 7 miles, but you can find plenty of fine, protected campsites all along the route, so tailor the length of the snowshoe trek to your own preferences.<br><br>From the 4900-foot junction with the Hex Mountain Trail, the Sasse Ridge Trail heads north, dropping gradually through thin forests in the first mile before climbing once more until, at 5.3 miles, the trail rolls under the crown of a high, unnamed peak (5159 feet). The trail then banks right, drops slightly into a high saddle, and climbs again to 5400 feet at 5.8 miles. Wind exposure and potential avalanche dangers are possible on this stretch of the trail. If conditions are unstable, head back and make camp in the first sheltered site, either near the saddle or on the south side of the unnamed peak.<br><br>The trail curves north again at 5.9 miles and at 7.5 miles passes just under the summit of Sasse Mountain. The scramble to the summit is easy because the peak is open and round. Enjoy unmatched views from the top of Sasse, and either find a suitable campsite in the thin forests on the mountain&apos;s protected southern flank or head back down the trail to find a sheltered camp. <br><br>North of Sasse Mountain, the trail crosses a steep, open ridge section that is a dangerous avalanche area. The windswept ridge is seldom stable or secure, so only highly experienced winter mountaineers should even consider going farther, and they should do so only when avalanche dangers are low.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Backcountry<br>These routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses.

Fortunately, even though the road winds through old clear-cuts, the scenery is remarkably enjoyable. The old clearings provide grand views across the Cle Elum Valley toward Polallie Ridge and Davis Peak.

This route is occasionally used by cross-country skiers, but more often than not, snowshoers will find they have the wide, pretty trail all to themselves.<br>The trail is relatively flat, and finding the route is not difficult, even in heavy snow years, because the trail corridor is wide and nearly straight. Snowshoers can enjoy their surroundings here as they stroll up the path, gazing in wonder at the beautiful snow-shrouded landscape. The forest is a mixed bag of old pine and fir, so it is generally open and light. Sun streaks in through the thin canopy to keep the valley bright and sunny. Deer are frequently seen in this valley, even in winter, and many small birds and animals can be seen along the trail as well. Kids and adults alike will enjoy studying and trying to identify the many animal tracks left in the snow beside the trail and along the riverbanks.<br><br>Snowshoe up the road past the ranger station, and cross the river toward the Salmon la Sac Campground. The trail is well signed and easy to find. Stay right, and snowshoe up a small service road. The trailhead is located on this road, about 200 feet past the gated entrance to the campground. The trail stays alongside, but not too near, Cooper River for its entire length. If you have difficulty finding the trail--especially in the first 0.5 mile--just head northwest, keeping the river off to your left, but no more than 50 or 60 yards away.<br><br>The first 0.5 mile is in fairly open, airy forest, so the snow piles deep and obscures landmarks and trail tread. Beyond this section, the route is easy to find. The wide corridor skirts the bottom edge of the Polallie Ridge wall where it meets the Cooper River valley bottom. The views, while not amazing, are quite picturesque. In addition to the scenic river views, you can catch occasional glimpses up the valley of Polallie Ridge on the right and Chikamin Ridge straight ahead. <br><br>The valley narrows considerably after the first 0.5 mile, and at 1 mile, the trail is squeezed tight into a narrow gorge. The river quickens, and the trail climbs until, at 2 miles, it levels out and the valley opens up again. The walls stay close, but not nearly as confining as the section just passed. The last 1.5 miles of trail ramble gently and serenely to a junction with Forest Road 4616 along the banks of Cooper Lake. To see the lake, and enjoy a lunch spot with pretty views of the lake and the high ridges around it, turn right onto the road and hike up a few hundred yards to catch the Lake Shore Trail on the left. Drop down along this trail, and skirt the lake to any one of a dozen good viewpoints and picnic areas. Owhi Campground is just a 0.5 mile up the lakeshore if a larger lunch spot is needed.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful.

The opportunity to sweat buckets goes for a premium in places like L.A. and New York. Yet you get to subject yourself to this brutal experience for free. What&apos;s more, while you exhaust yourself on this long, hot hike up a ruthlessly steep trail, you also earn great rewards: views that can&apos;t even be imagined by people chained to their treadmills. From Davis Peak you&apos;ll soak in sweeping views that include all of the splendid Alpine Lakes Wilderness and beyond.<br><br>From the parking area, hike across the road and follow the dirt road 0.5 mile to a bridge over the Cle Elum River. Continue along the trail for another 0.25 mile or so to where <br><br>the path widens onto an old logging road for the next mile. By the end of this mile, the trail has turned vertical, entering a seemingly endless series of switchbacks. The trail bounces you back and forth so much you&apos;ll feel like a pinball--especially on the fast descent.<br><br>About 2.5 miles from the trailhead, you&apos;ll break out of the thinning forest cover, with the remainder of the climb--all 3 miles of it--under the full glare of the sun. Make sure your sunscreen is waterproof, or you&apos;ll sweat it off in no time. The sun-drenched, clear-cut &quot;wildflower meadows&quot; are a curse on hot summer days, but even then they are also a blessing, since with every plodding step upward you&apos;ll find ever-better views.<br><br>By the time you reach the crown of Davis Peak at 5.5 miles, you&apos;ll have earned the stellar views that ring you. Your panoramic vision stretches out 360 degrees, sweeping in the vast expanse of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in all its glory. Mount Rainier also pokes up on the southern horizon. It&apos;s all stunning, and it&apos;s all yours--you earned it, so sit back and enjoy it!\n                 ",

This choice is also an opportunity to do a one-way hike and take an alternate form of transportation back.  If you have friends with the canoe, arrange to meet them on the river.  If you&#x2019;re traveling with companions of varying hiking abilities, arrange to meet them at Maidenhair falls with the car.  Maidenhair Falls and the accompanying gorge is a mere half mile from its trailhead and is a worthwhile destination for waterfall lovers.<br><br>For those who prefer a long walk, the trail continues along the east side of the lake.

From this trailhead, complete with picnic benches and shelters, as well as maps of the preserve, it&apos;s an easy walk to Mukai Pond, a lovely wetland ringed with beautiful, colorful willows.<br><br>The westside entrance is a wide spot in the road, but don&apos;t let the nearby restored Borrow Pit or the landfill next door stop you from heading into the park! After stopping to admire the great restoration work on the borrow pit, you&apos;ll soon be in lush forest--hushed and quiet, save for birds and squirrels. You will forget you&apos;re at a County park.<br><br>A third access point is the Cemetary Trailhead, accessible from 115th Ave SW off SW Cemetary Road. This trailhead is more convenient for island locals, while visitors to Vashon will probably opt for the 118th St. entrance. <br><br>There are 10 miles of trail at Island Center Forest, plenty of opportunity to wander to your heart&apos;s content. But be sure to take a map; there are some confusing intersections, though many are signed. And of course, as with any park adjacent to a neighborhood, there are many waytrails leading to homes. Having a map will help you avoid wandering into someone&apos;s backyard. <br><br>Some trails can be quite muddy on a rainy day, and during the rainiest months, it is not possible to approach the walks at Mukai Pond or Meadowdale Pond, due to high water. If this is the case, go back another time!<br><br>Watch for bicyclists and equestrians, and remember that this is a working forest, with recovery in process, so there may be trail closures. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Consider making this a bike trip! It costs less to take a bike on the Fauntleroy Ferry, and the RapidRide C Line makes a stop at the terminal. From the Vashon terminal, huff and puff up the admittedly steep hill or hop on the bus. The bus stops just north of town, where you can bike to the turnoff at 188th St SW. If you&apos;re riding the whole way, know that the turnoff is 5.4 miles from the terminal. <br><br>Trails in the park are bike friendly, or you can lock up your bike and hike. Afterwards, you can coast back through town, stopping for a bite to eat at Dragonfly Cafe and a browse at the bookstore. When you&apos;re ready to head home, hop on your bike and cruise back down to the ferry terminal.</p>\n                 ",

Rarely can you find such lovely sites with so little effort, but here, a short trek will take you through forests, across delicate streams, and past brightly colored wildflowers. Humming with butterflies, birds, bees, and babbling streams, this trail is not to be missed.<br><br>From the lower parking area, you&#x2019;ll notice a small sign pointing toward the Mirror Lake trailhead. Follow the wide, rocky dirt path approximately 0.5 miles to meet the trailhead for Mirror Lake.

Keep your eye out for them as they can be easy to miss. Continue down the trail for 0.4 miles where you will come across a small stream. Walk carefully across as the rocks are slippery. In another 0.1 miles consider taking a short detour on the spur trail to Cottonwood Lake. The lake--pond really--is frequented by swimmers looking to beat the heat on a summer day. <br><br>After a short but moderately strenuous additional 0.6 miles, you will reach the edges of Mirror Lake. There are campsites dotted all around the shores of the lake as well as spots that are perfect for a picnic or relaxing in the sun. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: When you arrive at Mirror Lake, you will come to a junction between the Mirror Lake Trail and Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). For those willing to put in just a little extra effort, head south (left) on the PCT following the path along the lake shore for another 0.3 miles. You will come across wonderful, unobstructed views of the lake and Silver Peak standing tall in the distance. And don&#x2019;t forget to bring your bathing suit!

The route holds to a broad, easy-to-follow road for the first 1.5 miles before dropping into the woods to ramble along a narrow hiking path. At the end of the route, you&apos;ll find a small lake set deep in the woods. Despite its proximity to the popular ski areas of Snoqualmie Pass and the busy roadway of Interstate 90, this is a wonderful place to find wildlife in the winter. Deer frequent this valley, as they find forage in the deep forests, but it is far more likely you&apos;ll see tracks and trails of snowshoe hares, martens, weasels and--hot on the trail of those three--bobcats and cougars. You&apos;ll find grouse perched in the trees, and gray jays flitting through the branches. The only thing missing is expansive views, but sometimes its nice to focus on beauty close at hand, and this route offers that aplenty.<br><br>From the Sno-Park, trek about .75 mile east along the Iron Horse Trail before finding blue blazes to the south, marking your turn onto FR 9070. Frequently during the winter, both the Iron Horse and FR 9070 are groomed by the Summit Nordic Center of The Pass Ski Resort. Be sure to stick to the outside edges of the trail if it is groomed, and if not groomed, avoid any well-laid ski tracks whenever possible. <br><br>FR 9070 climbs the Cold Creek valley, heading west around the southern flank of Mount Catherine. The going is easy as the road climbs just 400 feet in nearly 1.5 miles. Watch the edges of the road, and peer under the eaves of the forest along the road for signs of wildlife. <br><br>At 1.5 miles and 3000 feet, the road rounds a sharp hairpin turn. Leave the road, dropping off the left side of the road just before the apex of the turn, and continue trekking west (the road begins to climb north-northwest to Route 59, Windy Pass/Mount Catherine). There is a narrow hiking trail here, but with a blanket of snow the trail is nearly impossible to find. No need to worry, though. Just pick a route that carries you west at a fairly level pace--a slight ascent is what you&apos;re actually going for, but not much. At just 0.5 mile past the point where you left the road, you&apos;ll find a small lake nestled in the deep second-growth forest. (The &quot;twin&quot; of this Twin Lake is further up the valley, and is too small and insubstantial to bother with.)

Silver Peak and its neighbors are reached by way of FR-9070, a gateway to the less-traveled but better-kept secrets of the Cascades. FR-9070 has its share of potholes and is generally snow-free from July until November. Approximately five miles from Hyak, FR-9070 reaches an intersection with the Pacific Crest Trail, at a saddle between Mount Catherine and Silver Peak.<br><br>The most common direct route to Silver Peak follows the Pacific Crest Trail south for 1.7 miles and continues along a side trail that turns 180 degrees and ascends the southern flank of Silver Peak. After parking along FR-9070, find the intersection with the Pacific Crest Trail (#2000) at 3800 feet of elevation and head south. Salmonberry and blueberry bushes line your route. After it leaves the saddle, the Pacific Crest Trail gently gains elevation, then dips to cross the north fork of Cold Creek two tenths of a mile from the trailhead. The Pacific Crest Trail enters an alpine forest populated by noble fir, western hemlock, and mountain hemlock. The trail meanders through the forest southward past beargrass, arnica, bluebells, western columbine, foamflower, fireweed, cow parsnip, and milkweed that blossom in the summer. Bumblebees, chipmunks, hummingbirds, and pikas can be seen or heard along this section of the trail. Flies and mosquitoes can be bothersome in the summer months.<br><br>1.7 miles from the trailhead, watch closely for a turn-off up and to the right, marked with cairns. If you pass a tarn on the left, you have gone too far. The side trail climbs steadily for three tenths of a mile to Windy Pass, a saddle between Silver and Tinkham Peaks at 4600 feet of elevation. This section requires some brief moments of class 2 or 3 scrambling. At Windy Pass, there is a fork in the trail. A turn to the left takes you to Tinkham Peak, which towers over Windy Pass. Turn to the right (northwest) to go to Silver Peak. As you continue to ascend, the Cold Creek valley opens below you, with Mount Catherine facing you across the valley. You will then turn north and face views of Silver Peak&#x2019;s summit block. The trail descends briefly before reaching the final ascent to the summit.<br><br>One-half mile from Windy Pass the tread becomes rocky, and the incline becomes steep, gaining 600 feet over the last three tenths of a mile. Handholds are occasionally required, making for more class 2 scrambling. As you huff and puff your way to the summit, Mount Rainier rises above the horizon behind you. Blue harebells and arnica line the trail in the summer. Just as the trail levels off for a moment, deceiving you into a sense of completion, you round a bend with the summit in view. Don&#x2019;t quit, as you are very close to panoramic views of Snoqualmie Pass. Stuart is to the east, and Rainier and Adams are to the south. Keechelus Lake is to the east, and Annette Lake lies just beneath you to the southwest. On a clear day, you can see north all the way to Mount Shuksan. Take care when you descend, as the rock can be loose in many places.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: August and September are the best months for ripe berry picking.

Mount Catherine, of course! This off-the-beaten-path hike to the summit of a wintertime ski destination is one of the most rewarding climbs along the southern wall of Snoqualmie Pass.<br><br>The trailhead for Mount Catherine is reached via FR-9070, a gateway to some of the less-traveled and better-kept secrets of the Cascades. FR-9070 has its share of potholes and is usually snow-free from July until November. Park along the south side of FR-9070 across from a modest sign indicating trail #1348. There are no water sources on this hike, but the round trip is only three miles.<br><br>Mount Catherine packs in 1,330 feet of elevation gain over 1.5 miles, so be prepared for a hike that climbs aggressively with switchbacks as it ascends the mountain&#x2019;s southern flank. Catch your breath and note the western and mountain hemlock cones that line the trail. Subalpine fir is another resident of this neighborhood, occupying the more wind-exposed turns of the trail. Blowdowns occasionally pose obstacles along this trail.<br><br>The first 0.7 miles of trail lift you up to the ridgeline at 4,700 feet of elevation, near the western side of the mountain. The trail then traces the ridgeline for 0.6 miles, heading east and climbing more gently. In the early summer this section of the trail may be partially covered by lingering snow. Over the last 0.2 miles, nearing the summit block, the trail turns north and views start to open. Mount Rainier looms over the horizon behind you. Circle around the summit block, turning east again, where you may encounter a snow bank in June and early July&#x2014;cross carefully if there is snow, as there is nothing to stop your slide for more than 100 feet. Just beneath the summit, you may encounter a cable that can be used to assist in a brief scramble that gains the final 20 feet to the top. Alternatively, there are class 2-scramble bootpaths that reach the top.<br><br>As you close in on the summit, huckleberry bushes line the trail. Berries tend to ripen in August and September. The rare and endangered Taylor&#x2019;s checkerspot butterfly frequents this summit, too. When you reach the top, from left to right, Mount Rainier, Tinkham Peak, and Silver Peak dominate the view. To the east, in the distance, is Mount Stuart. North of you lie Chair Peak, Kaleetan Peak, Red Mountain, and Snoqualmie Mountain. To the northwest, if you squint, you can make out the fire lookout atop Granite Mountain. And to the southeast is glorious blue Keechelus Lake.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Since the round-trip distance for this hike is a relatively short, consider combining Mount Catherine with Tinkham Peak, Silver Peak, or Twin Lakes, as the trailheads for those hikes are also along FR-9070.</p>\n                 ",

The lower section, though, is unremarkable. The flat roadway, parallel to noisy Interstate 90, is a great place for novice snowshoers to get a feel for hiking with the broad &quot;foot boards,&quot; and it does serve as a good warm-up for the long climb ahead. The real treasures of the Mount Margaret trek are found beyond the second mile. Because this area is close to the metropolitan centers, a lot of skiers and snowshoers share the trail. That, combined with the closeness of the busy freeway, means the chances of seeing wildlife are pretty slim. Still, where people play in the woods, camp-robber jays look for handouts. This valley is also patrolled by many red-tailed hawks and ravens, so watch the skies for raptors and corvids, and look for the tiny tracks of their prey (mice, hares, and grouse) in the meadows.<br><br>The first 1.5 miles of the snowshoe hike follow the road southeast from the parking area, parallel to I-90. This leg of the journey is frequently used by cross-country skiers who are just learning their craft, and it makes a nice place to familiarize yourself with your snowshoes. The road curves around the base of Rampart Ridge, with just a few modest views west toward Mount Catherine and Roaring Ridge above the waters of Keechelus Lake. <br><br>After crossing Wolfe Creek, the road climbs gradually, switches back to recross the creek, and just a few hundred yards beyond the second crossing, switches back once more to start a long, traversing climb through intermittent forest and clearcuts to mile 2.5. Two more switchbacks are encountered in the next 0.5 mile, and at 3.2 miles, the road splits. The left fork continues to climb while the right stays at a level traverse before dropping toward the I-90 valley. Staying left, climb for another 0.5 mile to 3600 feet and a gate marking the Mount Margaret trailhead. <br><br>The trail is wide for a hiking path--it&apos;s actually an old jeep road--so it is very easy to follow even when deep in snow. The path zigzags steeply up the side of a ridge, through broad clearcut meadows. Save some travel time by angling east, still climbing steeply, to the eastern edge of a large meadow. Pause here to soak in the views of the Snoqualmie Pass area, Keechelus Lake, and the sprawling clearcut-pocked mountains of the South Cascades. On clear days, Mount Rainier and sometimes even Mount Adams are visible to the south.<br><br>Continue uphill toward the ridge crest (now heading north), following the road through a small forested area, another meadow, and finally a solid, respectable stand of trees. The last 0.5 mile is along a true hiking trail in deep forest. It climbs, weaving around trees, along the crest of the ridge to a high promontory below the craggy summit of Mount Margaret. Below, on the eastern side of the ridge, is tiny Margaret Lake. Reaching its shores, though, requires a steep descent along an avalanche-prone slope, so stay on the ridge and enjoy the wonderful views.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Easiest to More Difficult<br>Generally good trails for beginners, with moderate elevation change and minimal avalanche danger\n                 ",

Fortunately, a few miles up the trail, the crowds thin--or at least spread out--and snowshoers can get on with the business of learning to travel in a beautiful wilderness valley. That&apos;s right, just a few miles after leaving the buzzing Interstate 90 corridor, the Alpine Lakes Wilderness unfolds. By mid-December, the snow is usually deep enough for the outing to be enjoyable, making this a great destination for families who gave each other snowshoes for Christmas.<br><br>To get there, from Seattle drive east on I-90 over Snoqualmie Pass to exit 54, 2 miles east of the pass&apos;s summit.

The road stays tight to the eastern wall of the valley, but if the snow is deep enough to bury all the ground cover, drop off the road in a few hundred yards--just past Mardee Lake--and snowshoe up the open meadow and through the thin stands of forest. As you hike up the valley, the view of Kendall Peak gets better and better, while on your right, Rampart Ridge rolls majestically along. As the valley tapers in, the meadows give way to wide stands of trees and small forest clearings. The walls close in tighter and tighter on the valley floor, and the views become more dramatic. At about 2.5 miles in, stop and enjoy the scenery and the feeling of power that this winter wilderness emits. <br><br>At the northern end of Rampart Ridge is the bulky summit of Alta Mountain; directly opposite is the vertical face of Kendall Peak. The steep walls of these mountains seem to rise from the ground at your feet. Continue to press on up the valley, but only if you know how to evaluate avalanche dangers. Even on the valley floor, hikers are susceptible to avalanches. The mammoth slides can come barreling off the valley walls with enough momentum that they sweep well out onto the basin&apos;s floor. <br><br>Stroll to your heart&apos;s content along the valley floor, then weave your way through the trees back to the starting point for a gentle day on the snow.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Easiest to More Difficult<br>Generally good trails for beginners, with moderate elevation change and minimal avalanche danger.\n                 ",

The Snoqualmie Tunnel is part of the Iron Horse State Park&apos;s 110-mile long trail and is a must do for everyone! Views for most of your trip will be determined by the power of your headlamp, but there will be some sights on the other side. The attraction of this hike is the mysterious, dramatic tunnel itself. However, note that the tunnel is closed November 1st through May 1st, so plan your trip accordingly.<br><br>After reaching the parking lot, find the trail opposite the bathrooms. Once on the trail look west and follow the wide gravel path toward a metal gate one tenth of a mile away. This gate blocks the trail but is easy to bypass on foot or on bike.<br><br>At a third of a mile you will find the entrance to the tunnel. If it&#x2019;s a warm day you will feel the cool air funneling out of the tunnel. This cool breeze may just send a shiver down your spine, reminding you of the long dark walk awaiting you. At this point, think about donning a jacket as even on the hottest summer day the tunnel stays cool, even chilly. With the damp air, water periodically dripping from the ceiling and the darkness, you will certainly feel cold without that coat. Some people will even bring gloves and a hat for the walk through. Just before entering the darkness, strap on your headlamp or dig your flashlight out of your pack. You don&#x2019;t want to be looking for your light source in the dark! Did you check that they work and do you have spare batteries?<br><br>Other than a slight curve to the left at the beginning, once you&#x2019;re in the tunnel your hike is pretty straightforward, literally. You may even be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It&#x2019;s prudent to remember that the tunnel is 2.3 miles long, so while the light may seem promising, the end of your hike is still a long ways off. The tunnel is wide and very tall so there&#x2019;s plenty of room for all, as you go through this fascinating piece of Washington State history. The trail in the tunnel is in great shape with just a few potholes, which you can expect to find where water is dripping from the ceiling. <br><br>Once through, you will find a few picnic tables, a pit toilet, a garbage can and some nice views of the neighboring Cascade Mountains along the I-90 corridor. If it&#x2019;s a clear day try and find the lookout on top of Granite Mountain! After you&apos;ve located the lookout and eaten a snack, head back into the tunnel for your return trip. This time though, you will not have the light at the end leading you until you reach the bend in the tunnel near the start on the east side.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Wear reflective clothing. Bicyclists are faster than walkers and can come upon you quickly. Help them out by wearing reflecting clothing or even a blinking light on your back.</p>\n                 ",

The dark green firs and hemlocks lining the ridge, the open, quilted meadows of snow, and the wide avenue of the trail make this a perfect destination for snowshoers. <br>The trail leads to a pair of small alpine ponds nestled in a deep cirque on the flank of towering Kendall Peak (5,675 feet). The mountain dominates the skyline from the lake&apos;s basin, as well as along the last mile of the trail leading into the basin. But Kendall isn&apos;t the only peak on the horizon.

Below the lakes, the broad meadows along the bottom of the Gold Creek valley glimmer a brilliant white in the afternoon sun. Although the trail ascends nearly 2000 feet, the climbing is gradual and the trail is easy to follow. Because of that, first-time &#x2018;shoers and young kids will enjoy this outing as much as experienced snowshoe enthusiasts. Of course, all of those features coupled with the trail&apos;s close proximity to the Seattle metropolitan area means a lot of snowshoers and skiers on any winter weekend.

You can either stay with the moderate pitch of the road or take a steeper, more direct, northerly approach straight up the slope, cutting off the switchback corners. Pause often to rest.

A wide spur road heads off to the left, leading to a nice overlook of the lower Coal Creek basin and the ski areas at Snoqualmie Pass. Stay right if you are bound for the lakes. The road traverses east toward the snout of a narrow ridge and, at that leading edge of the ridge, turns north and climbs steeply through forest and meadow. The track stays on the west side of the ridge crest, banking right at 2.6 miles, and at 3.5 miles hooking sharply south in a switchback turn.<br><br>Stay north, snowshoeing off the road near the apex of the hairpin corner, climbing through mostly open slopes to the ridge crest leading to Kendall Lakes. The trail nears Coal Creek at 4.2 miles and follows it the remainder of the way to the lakes&apos; basin, rolling over two small knolls before reaching the lower of the twin Kendall Lakes. Avoid the upper lake because the tight, avalanche-prone walls of the cirque are not a safe way to approach it.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Most Difficult<br>Hikers should have good experience and familiarity with snowshoes. This route features sections that will need to be evaluated for avalanche safety every time. Trails climb considerably and may include climbing to ridge tops. Traverses across forested or open slopes may be required. An ability to self-arrest with an ice axe or trekking pole recommended.\n                 ",

But for good routefinders and those who don&apos;t mind an occasional deadfall, it&apos;s a good early-season route to the high country of Alaska Lake. Even hikers who opt not to push on to Alaska Lake will enjoy the valley hike as it explores the creek basin and its multitude of beaver ponds and flower-filled clearings.<br><br>The route follows the road as it heads north, deeper into the Gold Creek valley. Land on both sides of this road is privately owned, so don&apos;t wander off it for the first 0.5 mile. Past the end of the maintained road you&apos;ll find yourself on an old, abandoned miners track. This fading roadway peters out in another 0.25 mile, leaving you on a wide single-track trail. The path moves north along the floor of the valley, sometimes stretching out through thick forest, sometimes running along the foot of the slope in the dense vine maple brambles that clog avalanche chutes.<br><br>At 2 miles from the second gate the trail enters the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and a mile farther on you&apos;ll cross Gold Creek via a rough-hewn footlog. Look for beaver activity along the creek--spring snowmelt frequently blows out the beaver dams, but they are rebuilt quickly, and the chisel-toothed animals have left their mark on plenty of alders and aspens along the creek shores.<br><br>The trail crosses Silver Creek at 3.5 miles.

The valley approach, though fairly flat itself, is an avalanche danger zone, with several avalanche-chute runouts reaching the valley bottom. Don&apos;t trek up this valley unless the avalanche risk is low. But when the snow is stable, this can be a stunning place to visit, even though the first few miles are within hearing of Interstate 90 to the south. In addition to the vertical wall of Rampart Ridge to the east, there is the high summit of Alaska Mountain at the head of the valley, and the rocky spires of Kendall Peak to the west.<br><br>Head up the Gold Creek valley as described in Route 53, Lower Gold Creek Basin. Moving up the valley, you&apos;ll find the walls slowly drawing closer together. To the left (west) is the rocky bulk of Kendall Peak, while to your right (east) is the high, skyscraping wall of Rampart Ridge. The towering cliffs, topped with a ragged line of spires and pinnacles, create an impressive skyline even from the valley floor directly below. <br><br>At about 2.5 miles, the valley floor is narrow and many steep gullies and couloirs drop from the peaks above. These deep channels serve as natural avalanche chutes with snowslides regularly scouring them and depositing the fast-running slides on the valley floor. If the snow is stable during your visit (you did check with the Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center before your outing, right?), push on up the valley for another 2.5 miles, crossing in front of the mouth of Silver Creek valley on the north side of Kendall Peak, before reaching a small draw leading off to the left. This is the outlet stream from Alaska Lake. Leave Gold Creek, and begin your ascent of the valley wall here, heading north-northwest. Stay to the left (south) of the creek basin itself, hiking up the low ridge above the creek. The lake is just 1 mile up the slope, but the elevation gain in that mile is more than 1000 feet, so take your time. <br><br>Alaska Lake fills a small basin directly below Alaska Mountain and Ridge Lake, which both lie alongside the Pacific Crest Trail. Steep walls surround the lake, except at the outlet end, so plan your camp there to avoid potential avalanche chutes.

That&apos;s great news for snowshoers because the trail is easy to get to and enjoyable for snowshoeing. The route to Commonwealth Basin follows the PCT for more than 2 miles through shadowy old-growth forest--with an occasional break in the trees for views of the surrounding peaks--before setting off on a smaller path into the wide, rocky basin at the base of Red Mountain.<br><br>Commonwealth Basin affords excellent views of the iron-rich flanks of Red Mountain, although snowshoers will be at a loss to explore the source for the mountain&apos;s name since it is covered in a deep quilt of white snow all winter. There are also excellent views up to Kendall Peak and Snoqualmie Mountain from the basin.<br><br>Just north of the freeway underpass, a small snow-covered road climbs off to the right. Snowshoe up this road into a wide summer parking area at the PCT trailhead.

After looping through a couple more short switchbacks, the trail rolls north to a junction at 2.5 miles (4000 feet). <br><br>An alternate route, when snow is very deep, is to snowshoe up the narrow valley directly above the PCT parking area. Stay left and climb through the trees, keeping the small creek basin on your left until reaching the broad mouth of Commonwealth Basin.<br><br>The route to this point is easy to follow because the trail corridor is wide and obvious in the heavy forest. The trail stays under the forest canopy nearly all of the first 2.5 miles, although it does cross the base of a large avalanche slope and then recross the slope higher up after climbing through a switchback. Cross this slope with care, and if the avalanche danger is higher than moderate, avoid the area. The point where the trail crosses the slope is on the run-out section of the chute rather than the trigger area, so it is unlikely that you will trigger a slide here, but caution is still required.<br><br>At the trail junction, stay left--the PCT climbs steadily to the right--and follow the Commonwealth Creek valley up into the basin. The trail is a long, straight ascent up the valley, climbing gradually as it enters the basin. The forest thins, and finally falls away at 4 miles, leaving you on open slopes at the base of Red Mountain. Potential for avalanches exists here beyond timber line, so care and common sense must be used in heavy doses. If the snow is stable and safe, it&apos;s possible to scramble up to the 5300-foot level (about 5 miles from the trailhead) at a low saddle on the ridge between Red Mountain and Lundin Peak.

This deep canyon nestled in the shadows of Red Mountain and Kendall Peak offers a great opportunity to explore the wild heart of the Cascades with minimal driving and easy hiking. The trail starts just off the most heavily used highway in the Cascades, yet you&apos;ll soon find yourself caught deep in the wilderness experience as you stride into the fragrant forests, scrambling over the tumbling creeks of crystal-clear snowmelt waters and climbing through the rocky meadows in this mountain valley.<br><br>Start up the PCT as it climbs into the trees above the parking lot and makes a long, lazy sweep east before rounding a hairpin turn to return west across the lower end of an avalanche slope. The jumble of trees piled around the trail illustrate how powerful a little snow can be when it starts to slide downhill. The trail stays in the trees for 2.5 miles before reaching a fork. The PCT continues to climb, while your path angles off left, slicing up into the valley of Commonwealth Creek.<br><br>The trail continues up the creek for the next mile, climbing moderately to the headwall of the basin. Here, the going gets tough as the trail runs upward through a long series of tight, steep switchbacks. At nearly 4 miles the route levels a bit as the forest finally gives way to heather meadows.<br><br>At 4.5 miles you&apos;ll pass above Red Pond (elev. 4860 ft)--a short spur trail drops down to it. Huckleberries can be found in season around the pond basin, and a variety of wildflowers color the meadows above and below the pond.<br><br>The final 0.5 mile of trail gains 500 feet as it rises up to the saddle of Red Pass on the ridge between Red Mountain and Lundin Peak. Grand views can be enjoyed from here.<br><br>WTA Note: Dogs are required to be on leash at all times on this trail.\n                 ",

This section of trail is heavily rooted, with many large step-ups; to call it a trail is being generous. Though you travel only a mile, you&apos;ll gain 1200 vertical feet in this section. As you climb, you&apos;ll find distraction as you cross under a beautiful cascade where one of the many small streams cascades down a rock wall above you. Halfway up, you&apos;ll start getting great views back down Box Canyon. There are a number of false trails along the way, most of which have been blocked off with crossed sticks. Consult your map often and take heart; it will all be worth it when you top out at Rachel.<br><br>There are a number of campsites at the lake. Bearing right, the trail skirts the lake and then heads up an additional 600 vertical feet to Rampart Ridge. By comparison to what you just hiked, this section is in excellent shape--well constructed with switchbacks and no big step ups. There  are fabulous views from this trail back down on Rachel Lake.

Plenty of rewards await the dedicated athletes who point their snowshoes toward the top of this ridge. Best of all, even those who cut their trips short of the top will find the journey pays off tremendously.

This road climbs steeply up the flank of Keechelus Ridge alongside Price Creek for 0.5 mile before angling west away from the creek in a long, looping route that isn&apos;t too steep but does cover several miles.

As the road rolls farther west away from Price Creek, snowshoe up the slope away from the track, staying right while the road goes left. Parallel Price Creek uphill, but stay on the bench above the stream rather than descending into the brambles alongside it. The slope rolls upward over several small benches and false summits, crossing clearcuts old and new. In light snow years, take care to avoid hooking a snowshoe on some of the brush protruding in the older, grown-over cuts.<br><br>The climb covers about a mile of distance before crossing another heavily used road, FR 4934, just below the ridge crest (4300 feet). Emerge onto that road at about the same place as FR 124, which finally loops back from its long journey around the ridge flank. <br><br>Rather than joining FR 4934--a popular snowmobile route that creates a long loop when coupled with several other roads in the area--merely snowshoe across it, and head toward the ridge crest. This last 0.5 mile of climbing is also cross-country travel, although you can follow the road (FR 124) here too, if you are nervous about routefinding on the open ridge. The top is easily identifiable on the approach by tall radio relay towers.

But for peak-baggers, or those simply interested in getting a gorgeous view from a relatively easy-to-navigate peak, the views are worth the extra effort.<br> <br>After climbing to Navaho Pass, it&#x2019;s almost intuitive to begin wandering up the climber&#x2019;s trail to Navaho Peak. The pass itself is beautiful, with views of the Stuart Range and Earl Peak filling your view. But it&#x2019;s small, with not much room to spread out, and many a hiking group looking for a better lunch spot has found themselves climbing toward Navaho Peak.<br> <br>Head east out of the pass, paralleling the Stuart Range as you go. The trail is more or less straight up; a true climber&#x2019;s trail. The loose scree and soil is anchored somewhat in place by various wildflowers, including Indian Paintbrush and pentstemon, as well as phlox. These provide a welcome distraction from the continuous uphill plodding, as do the ever-improving views of the Teanaway, Central Washington sprawling beneath you, and the gray, snow-dotted peaks to the north. <br><br>It&#x2019;s a mile of climbing to reach the small summit of Navaho Peak, barely higher than a small rocky outcropping just to the east. Snow lingers up here into July, which can make the final push to the summit a bit of a route-finding endeavor, but once you&#x2019;ve attained the summit, put on your windbreaker and enjoy the views. <br><br>Play a peak identification game: how many of the surrounding summits can you name? Rainier and Adams make appearances on clear days, but even Mount Stuart can be hard to identify from this angle. Below you, the County Line Trail stretches away, down the Ingalls Creek valley into Chelan county, inviting even more exploration in the form of multi-day adventures. <br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: The summit of Navaho Peak only has room for about four or five people to sit comfortably, so if it&#x2019;s a weekend, share the summit with other hikers who have made the same trek as you.</p>\n                 ",

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. <br><br>From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean there isn&#x2019;t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey&apos;s shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. <br><br>The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. <br><br>From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a &#x2018;T&#x2019; junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You&#x2019;ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there&#x2019;s more of the same ahead of you.<br> <br>Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply&#x2013;-it&#x2019;s one of the best parts about this hike. <br><br>Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn&#x2019;t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.<br><br>Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south&#x2013;-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. <br><br>Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you&#x2019;ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It&#x2019;s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there.</p>\n                 ",

Still, snowshoers who don&apos;t mind making camp in the snowy forest will find Thorp Mountain Trail to be extraordinarily beautiful and serene.<br><br>The route climbs steeply at times, along both the road and the trail, but generally the snowshoeing is easy. Because the trail is in the bottom of the creek valley most of the way, there are few panoramic views; but looking upvalley, Thorp Mountain captivates snowshoers working their way toward it, and the creek valley itself provides plenty of pretty scenery.<br><br>Start snowshoeing up French Cabin Creek Road as it crosses the Cle Elum River and ambles 0.25 mile to the base of the valley wall. Then climb steeply up the ridge on the north side of French Cabin Creek. The road stays above the creek basin for 1.5 miles, switching back time and again. Take advantage of the open terrain, and cut straight up the slope rather than rambling around the looping turns. Near 2 miles, the summit of Red Mountain is seen to the north. This mountain will remain in view much of the next mile, and at 3.4 miles, the road crosses Thorp Creek and comes to a junction with the Thorp Creek Road. <br><br>Turn right onto Thorp Creek Road (3200 feet), and 1.5 miles up this road--5 miles from the start of the route--turn right to cross the creek and pick up the start of the narrow Thorp Mountain Trail. Consider pitching camp near here, so you can make an early-morning start of the steep climb toward the summit of Thorp Mountain. If the avalanche danger is moderate or higher, this is the end of the trail, period. From this point on, there are some severe avalanche slopes.<br><br>The trail follows the north side of Thorp Creek upvalley for another mile, crossing through old pine forest, dense alder thickets, and the base of a major avalanche chute. At 6 miles, the trail is up against the head of the creek valley and the serious climbing begins. In the next 1.5 miles, the trail gains 1600 feet to reach the 5100-foot bench on the ridge below the summit of Thorp Mountain. The scramble to the true summit at 5854 feet requires winter mountaineering skills. Better to stop at the ridge crest (if that is even attained) and enjoy the vistas offered there. Red Mountain, No Name Ridge, and West Peak tower all around, while the Cle Elum Lake basin is nestled below to the east and Kachess Lake lies below to the west.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Backcountry<br>These routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses.

This trail offers all that. A road loops, bobs, and weaves its way to the top of the mountain, but snowshoers don&apos;t need roads. There is enough open country on the side of the mountain that snowshoers can just point their shoes uphill and go, jumping onto the road when necessary to avoid particularly steep pitches or brambly clearcuts.<br>All that open country makes prime hunting habitat for raptors--red-tailed hawks and falcons--and ravens. Owls prowl the forest fringes, and bald eagles soar through between fishing trips up the Yakima River. Those birds are here for a reason, and that reason is rabbits, or more accurately, hares-- snowshoe hares, which bound through the meadows and burrow in the snow to eat the grasses underneath. Even if the white rabbits aren&apos;t seen, their tracks frequently are. This route is steep and has a high danger of avalanche at times, so avoid the mountain when forecasters report moderate or higher avalanche danger.<br><br>Before strapping on the snowshoes, walk north across the freeway overpass and find the start of Forest Road 4826 on the left. Snowshoe north on this wide, flat road. Note that the road is usually groomed, with tracks frequently set for skiers (twin, parallel grooves carved into the snow by a grooming machine), so steer your snowshoes well clear of the tracks. A quarter mile up the road, turn off onto FR 4822 and start to climb toward the summit of Amabilis. This trail switches back and forth a few times before slanting off to the south on a long traverse of the middle section of the mountain. <br><br>Cross a small creek, and at about 2 miles the road forks. A hard hairpin turn to the left leads you on a long looping route to the mountaintop. Snowshoeing straight off on the right-hand road leads to an even longer loop to the same point at the summit (which, incidentally, is almost directly up-slope from this intersection). <br><br>Either road will get you to the top, but if you are looking to avoid the roads, start off along the left fork, and in 0.5 mile leave the road by climbing on a more direct route up the slope while still slanting slightly to the left. The views are now spectacular. Looking south and west, the Yakima River and Keechelus Lake valley spread out at your feet, and beyond the rolling hills (with their many square scars of open clearcuts) the South Cascades sprawl to the horizon. <br><br>A half mile farther on, near the 3-mile mark, cross the road, which has flipped through a switchback turn and is now climbing south, and head straight upslope to the ridge crest. Turn right and follow the crest another mile to the 4554-foot summit. A thin stand of trees lines the summit crest, providing a degree of protection from the wind while you enjoy a scenic lunch before heading down the steep slopes.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Most Difficult<br>Hikers should have good experience and familiarity with snowshoes. This route features sections that will need to be evaluated for avalanche safety every time. Trails climb considerably and may include climbing to ridge tops. Traverses across forested or open slopes may be required. An ability to self-arrest with an ice axe or trekking pole recommended.</p>\n                 ",

It&apos;s not protected as wilderness, so you might hear or see motorcycles along the trails, but the grandeur of the country is worth that risk--fortunately, when you encounter motorcycles they disappear quickly from sight, even if the exhaust fumes and ringing in your ears linger for a time. This trail, though open to motors, offers hikers a rewarding excursion up a beautiful mountain in one of the most stunning parts of the Cascades, and Elbow Peak provides grand views and glorious wildflower-viewing opportunities.<br><br>The trail starts on road. Some gung-ho four-wheelers might drive farther up the rough dirt access road, but rational folks will realize a mile of hiking the old road is easier--and likely faster--than creeping up in a car.<br><br>At the end of this road section the trail climbs steeply up the face of the ridge, ignoring the need for switchbacks on its straight-up run. At 1.5 miles you&apos;ll crest a bench on the long ridge climb where you&apos;ll find the first fine views. Look out over the Middle Fork Teanaway country as you catch your breath.<br><br>Once you&apos;re breathing freely again, push on up the trail as it moderates its pitch. You&apos;ll climb more gently along a traverse of the flank of Yellow Hill at around 2 miles out. In another mile you&apos;ll push up the steep final pitch to the summit of Yellow Hill (elev. 5527 ft).<br><br>The summit provides your first clear views of Mount Rainier to the south. Elbow Peak towers upvalley, nearly in your grasp. If you want a short hike, stop at Yellow Hill. Mile-hungry hikers, though, should pause just long enough to snap a picture or two--the views are very photogenic--before dipping back down to the ridge to start up the long slope toward Elbow Peak.<br><br>Over the next 1.5 miles you&apos;ll swing around Yellow Hill and roll up and down along the ridgeline up the southeast face of Elbow. Every step brings great views. Jolly Mountain looms just past Elbow Peak. Mount Stuart stands as an impressive sentinel to the northeast. And of course, mighty Mount Rainier rises to the south.<br><br>The last 0.5 mile of hiking requires a scramble through the rocks atop Elbow. Finally, at 5 miles, the faint trail crosses the summit. From the top of Elbow Peak (elev. 5673 ft), enjoy outstanding views over all the Teanaway Country and beyond.\n                 ",

They offer delicate music for your eyes, sparkling flashes in the alpine sunlight. When properly treated, they offer needed refreshment for thirsty hikers. The Middle Fork Teanaway River offers all this and more. as it tumbles through a gorgeous mountain valley, home and habitat to a variety of birds, beasts and, yes, bugs. This riverside trail passes through rich valley meadows, grand old forests, and comfortable campsites for those who can&apos;t resist the chance to stay longer than a single day.<br><br>The Middle Fork Teanaway Trail (No. 1393) climbs gradually along the pretty river for an easy and fast hike if that&apos;s what you want. But I recommend enjoying it as an easy and slow hike. Bring the kids and stroll up the trail, letting the youngsters explore as you walk.<br><br>The trail leaves the trailhead with a fording of the river. Proceed up-stream for 0.25 mile to the point where the river valley narrows into a steep-walled canyon. At this point the trail runs on a bench above the river, but within the next 0.5 mile the trail slides closer to the river and occasionally gets too close--the tread disappears periodically in small washouts.<br><br>Unfortunately, the trail receives only occasional maintenance, so the tread may be rough--or missing--in places. Fortunately, the gentle slope of the land makes scrambling through these rough sections fairly easy.<br><br>As you near the 1-mile mark the trail crosses the river once more via a shallow ford. You&apos;ll cross the river again in about another 0.25 mile, then go back across yet again at just past 2 miles. Between fords, the trail alternates between cool forests and sun-streaked forest clearings. Look for wildlife--both ground-based critters such as deer and airborne beasts such as nuthatches and gray jays--in the margin areas where the forests open onto the clearings.<br><br>At 3 miles from the trailhead you&apos;ll come to yet another ford. About 0.5 mile past this last crossing you&apos;ll find a side stream--Way Creek--tumbling down to join the Middle Fork. In addition to the creek junction, you&apos;ll also find a trail junction. Continue a few dozen yards past the trail junction to find a broad campsite near the river. Stop here for lunch before turning back to complete your 7-mile hike.\n                 ",

Watch your step, and keep the kids close at hand if you don&apos;t want to be picking spines out of ankles.<br><br>Beezley Hills hosts an amazing flower display each spring, and the plethora of hedgehog cactus all seem to come in bloom at the same time--usually late April or early May. The spiny ground-hugging cactus sport bright, fluorescent-pink flowers that add a tropical feel to the desert.<br><br>Passing through the gate near the road at the top of the ridge leads you down an old jeep track. You can follow this two-track trail or head east to create a loop hike. Walk east along the first ridge spine you encounter to enter a wild garden filled with phlox, Hooker&apos;s balsamroot, daggerpod, and several examples of the very uncommon sulphur lupine--one of the only white lupine species in Washington State.<br><br>Once you leave the ridge-top area, the soils become more fertile and full, and as a result the flora changes. Look for arrowleaf balsamroot, death camas, lupine, fern-leaf desert parsley, squaw current, bearded owl-clover, larkspur, prairie star flower, long-flowered bluebells, thyme desert buckwheat, and more.<br><br>Continue east down one long deep draw and up to another highpoint ridge. Turning southward, drop into a deep draw filled with towering sage &quot;trees&quot;--this sagebrush is at times 8 feet tall! As you climb out of this draw, turn to the west and hike up to the original ridge to catch the jeep track.<br><br>The route provides a nice 3-mile loop, and the abundance of flowers and views means you can enjoy 3 or more hours of walking, moving slowly over that distance to savor the natural richness of the area.

    "desc": "\n                    This trail represents the epitome of snowshoeing in the Cascades: a long, steady, often-steep climb through lush old forests ending at a high ridge with panoramic views of unmatched beauty. After soaking in the scenic splendor at the summit, snowshoers then reverse direction and follow their tracks back down the slope. <br>What sets this trail apart from others is that the slopes are well forested and sheltered, so avalanche hazards are minimal and snowshoeing, though steep at times, is relatively easy. Starting from Salmon la Sac Road (State Route 903), the snowshoe hike begins with a climb on an old, winding logging road through mixed forest and small clearcuts. Some nice views are found on the way up the trail, but the best are left until snowshoers top the ridge and turn around to see the breathtaking vistas to the west. Cle Elum Lake sprawls directly underfoot, and just beyond that is Mount Baldy, Thomas Mountain, West Peak, and Thorp Mountain along the crest of Kachess Ridge.<br><br>If you park at Newport Creek, walk up the highway to FR 116 before strapping on your snowshoes and starting the climb. The road leads northeast, always climbing, past several spur roads and side trails. Most of these are easily discernible as secondary roads, but at times the forks and junctions can be confusing. Unfortunately, trying to map all the junctions and byways is difficult, so you will have to use your best judgment and occasionally backtrack if you make a wrong turn. (Fortunately, the side roads are generally short, so you&apos;ll quickly realize your errors. For example, if the road dips or heads too far off the northeast bearing that is required, it&apos;s the wrong road.)<br><br>After the first mile of the road, the options decrease and the main road is the only one to follow until, at 1.2 miles, the road traverses above a small creek valley and, at 1.7 miles, ends at the summer trailhead parking area. Here is where the fun really begins. Snowshoeing up the narrow forest trail as it climbs the ridge crest toward Hex Mountain is a wonderful experience. With snowshoes you can easily climb, weave around trees, and generally enjoy the day as you soak in the beauty of the forest environment. This area is home to red foxes and an assortment of birds and small animals. Of course, whiskey jacks pester every human who enters the forest, thus living up to their alias, camp-robber jays, and great horned owls silently patrol the woods in search of mice, voles, martens, and hares.<br><br>The trail climbs for more than 1.5 miles, with only occasional glimpses of the world beyond the trees. At 3.3 miles from the start of the hike, the trail tops out on the south end of Sasse Ridge, just below the summit of Hex Mountain (Route 62 continues along Sasse Ridge). Turn right onto the Sasse Ridge Trail, and hike 0.25 mile to the summit for striking views of the eastern Cascades.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope.\n                 ",

Each name has history, and depending on if you&apos;re a local or a visitor, you may have heard a different name. <br><br>Originally, locals referred to it as Mount Pete, in honor of Pete Chorak, a Yugoslavian immigrant who settled in Enumclaw in the early 1900s, became a successful business owner, and donated some land to the town of Enumclaw. As the years wore on, &quot;Pete&quot; got misconstrued as &quot;Peak&quot;, hence the newer name, Mount Peak. <br><br>Between 1928 and 1971, a fire lookout perched atop the mountain was called the Pinnacle Peak Lookout, thereby dubbing the summit with a third name: &quot;Pinnacle Peak&quot;. The two trails that approach the summit even have their own names: The Cal Magnusson trail, and the more direct South Trail. But whatever you call this delightful dayhike in Enumclaw, you&apos;ll get to the same place; a beautiful site of a former lookout with views of the White River drainage and the jewel of the southern Cascades: Mount Rainier. Visitors can hike, bike, run or watch wildlife. <br><br>Following the Cal Magnusson Trail, hikers will climb 1000 feet in a mile, ensuring a healthy workout through thick forest. Hikers may find fascination in the basalt outcroppings just short of the summit; these are formed by the rapid cooling of lava tubes and are relatively common in the South Cascades, though always an interesting sight. <br><br>If you&apos;re inclined to take the South Trail, you can expect multi-user company. Mountain bikes are permitted on this old gravel road. Because of this, the grade is more forgiving. That, combined with views of the White River and Mount Rainier make this a gentler route, though there is elevation gain to be had as the trail enters the forest and approaches the summit. If you do elect to take this route, don&apos;t forget to take a look at the columnar basalt formations, visible just a little ways down the Cal Magnusson trail from the summit. <br><br>Once you&apos;ve achieved the summit, take a look around the former lookout site. You can see old concrete footings that formerly supported the lookout. Now logs have been placed across these to serve as benches, where you can take a load off and enjoy the view, including Mount Rainier and much of the surrounding valley. <br><br>After you&apos;ve had your fill of views, head back down, either the way you came, or try for a thru-hike by heading down the trail you didn&apos;t use on the way up. Keep in mind that if you opt to do this, you&apos;ll need to arrange a car shuttle or a key swap, but it means you&apos;ll get to explore this park to its fullest in just one day.</p>\n                 ",

Also be sure to grab an information pamphlet, which includes a map of the hiking trails in the area. <br><br>There are several hiking options in the refuge, but the most exciting is the Nisqually Estuary Boardwalk Trail.

When it&apos;s out, folks will be treated to mudflats peppered with shorebirds searching for food.<br><br>The trail features an observation tower, an enclosed viewing platform, several push-outs for those who want to linger with their binoculars and two covered viewing platforms.

If the DNR can only bring some of this same care to other parts of the Capitol State Forest, the possibilities are great.<br><br>The McLane Creek Nature Trail consists of a 1.1-mile outer loop and a 0.3-mile connector trail. My recommendation: do a figure-eight and take your sweet time. With interpretive plaques and observation decks along the way, McLane Creek is meant to be savored. Time of day and season will dictate which critters you might observe. Keep your senses keen and you should see plenty anytime you visit.<br><br>The trail starts off by skirting a large beaver pond. In springtime the wetland is transformed into a musical marsh thanks to a chorus of blackbirds and an ensemble of tree frogs performing regularly. Cattails and pond lilies punctuate the nutrient-rich wetland. Soon you&apos;ll encounter the shortcut trail. Once part of the Mud Bay Logging Company&apos;s rail line, this trail offers more good views of the beaver pond and perhaps a peek of the beavers themselves.<br><br>The main trail darts into a dark and gloomy forest of cedar, hemlock, giant maples and over-your-head devil&apos;s club. Heading along McLane Creek look for spawning salmon come fall. The trail passes through a hemlock tunnel that children will want to pass through again and again. Next, traverse a skunk cabbage patch before returning to the beaver pond. Take the shortcut trail right or head left to loop around the willow-, alder-, and cascara-lined wetland, returning to the trailhead.\n                 ",

Stroll into the meadows at the fringe of the broad, table-flat plateau of Grand Park, and it seems as if the vast field of wildflowers stretches endlessly before you. The meadows are occasionally broken by small stands of woodlands, several of which are &quot;silver forests&quot;--the still-standing weathered-gray skeletons of trees killed by forest fire. The &quot;official&quot; access to Grand Park requires a long 14-mile round-trip hike in from Sunrise. That&apos;s a beautiful trail, but that long walk gets you only to the edge of the meadows. Better to visit Grand Park by the backdoor.<br><br>As you start into this hike, note that the section of trail from the trailhead to Lake Eleanor just inside the national park boundary was built by boots. It was created mostly by anglers looking for fast access to the fish in Lake Eleanor. Today, though, so many hikers have trod this trail that the &quot;boot-built&quot; section is in better condition than most officially built trails in the surrounding national forest. <br><br>The trail angles southwest from the trailhead, rolling upward through cool forest, running up the Eleanor Creek basin. The trail crosses over into Mount Rainier National Park in about 0.25 mile, then reaches Lake Eleanor (elevation 4985 feet) at 1 mile. <br><br>From the lake, the trail climbs to the east over a low ridge, then turns southwest again upward through the forest to a modest meadow at about 1.5 miles. Look for deer and even elk (from the huge White River herd) in this forage-rich meadow before continuing onward and upward. Another mile of forest walking leads to the start of increasingly open forest glades and small meadows. <br><br>At 3 miles out, the forest clearings merge into the start of the broad meadows of Grand Park. Follow the trail as it hugs the western edge of the park and at 3.5 miles, stop for the first fantastic views of Mount Rainier. You can amble out into the meadows to find the best photographic vantage points or continue to follow the trail along its southwesterly route to get the full grandeur of Grand Park. The meadows continue on for more than 1 mile, and you&apos;ll hit a trail junction at 4.5 miles. This is a great place to turn back.\n                 ",

Just stick to the edges of the road to avoid tromping on skiers&apos; tracks, and take advantage of any opportunity to climb off the road and cross open meadows for maximum snowshoeing fun. <br>Attaining the summit of Sun Top requires considerable energy, but the workout is well rewarded with unmatched views of the country northwest of Mount Rainier. The White River valley stretches below the mountain, and Mount Rainier towers above. The lower section of the route is sometimes visited by the White River elk herd, so keep an eye out for the big beasts. This is also prime cougar country (due, in large part, to the presence of the elk). Seeing one of the big cats is a pleasure. Cougars pose little threat to adult humans, although kids shouldn&apos;t be allowed to run ahead. The odds of seeing a mountain lion are extremely low, but a couple lucky snowshoers have excitedly reported seeing the tawny cats streaking away from the road when the elk are nearby.<br><br>The route to the summit follows FR 7315. Snowshoe up the only road leaving the Sno-Park, pass the gate, and in a couple hundred feet, turn left up FR 7315. The road climbs steadily to the summit, and because of the frequent clearcuts encountered along the hike there are ample opportunities to stop, rest, and savor the scenery spread out before you. As the trail climbs the ridgeline, look down into the wide White River valley and the narrower, darker Huckleberry Creek basin. The best place to find elk is along the lower clearcuts, although from the higher clearcuts it&apos;s possible to look down into the open meadows along the rivers. Using a good pair of binoculars, scan the river meadows for the large herds that live in the White River drainage.<br><br>A few spur roads are found along the way, and these make nice diversions from the well-traveled main road. Snowshoe out along them for a new view, and then angle up through the trees and meadows to rejoin the main trail. By climbing straight through the larger clearcuts rather than following the looping road, you can save nearly a mile and enjoy some untracked snow. <br><br>Following the road all the way, it is 5 miles to a high bench below the summit of Sun Top. The summit approach requires crossing some serious avalanche slopes, so attempt the top only when conditions are stable and avalanche dangers are reported as low. For the best views south to Rainier, angle southwest around the bench about 400 yards to an open view of Mount Rainier and all the lesser peaks between.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful.

From either direction, the trail is wide and mostly free of rocks and roots, making it an ideal outing for all abilities. <br><br>When the sound of rushing water begins to overpower the noise of the river, catch glimpses of Skookum Falls through the trees as you approach Skookum Creek - this will be 2.1 miles for the shorter trail option and 3.9 miles for the longer. Just across the water, a sign points uphill with the simple word &#x201C;Falls.&#x201D; The bootpath up to the base of Skookum Falls is rough, and spray from the falls can make the path slick. Use caution if you choose to get a closer look. The falls puts on the best show when it&#x2019;s flowing in full force, usually in late spring and early summer. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: This fairly flat, early-season trail is very popular with dog walkers and mountain bikers, so plan to share the trail and be courteous to all users.</p>\n                 ",

The road is closed at the park boundary shortly after the first heavy snowfall, and the 5.5-mile trip to the lakeshore is a favorite of skiers and snowshoers who want to enjoy the beauty of the park, without working too hard at their sports. The road is steep in places, but overall it is moderately sloped and wide enough for snowshoers and skiers to enjoy together. <br><br>Snowshoers will find themselves climbing through lush, old cedar forests--some truly massive trees are found in this area--and thinner stands of fir and hemlock before arriving at the lake with its views of Tolmie Peak, Paul Peak, and Mount Rainier. The lake has an array of excellent campsites, each well sheltered but with great views all around. The gentle road hike in makes this a good destination for novice winter campers as well as seasoned cold-weather fanatics.<br><br>From the gate at the park boundary (3000 feet), hike up the road as it skirts around the flank of Martin Peak and climbs gradually up the Meadow Creek valley, passing the Paul Peak Trail (Route 75) at 1 mile. The thick tree cover is broken by an occasional small clearing, but dense, ancient forests dominate the first 2 miles of the route. At this point, the road rolls through the Mowich Meadows--small fields of snow nestled among the trees. The road curves right past the meadows and climbs steeply for a few hundred yards, rolling south through a sweeping curve. At 3 miles, rather than following the road down through a roundabout course, find a small trail on the left and climb steeply for 0.25 mile to rejoin the road at 4400 feet, thus trimming more than a half mile off the distance to the lake. <br><br>Instead of rejoining the wandering road at the junction, cross the road and start up another trail as it climbs steeply to the south, cutting across the neck of a long northerly loop in the road. A half mile up this trail, at 3.8 miles, cross the road once more and stay on the small forest trail as it continues to angle up the slope on a southern bearing. This 0.5-mile trail cuts nearly a mile off the road distance. Road hikers will sweep west with the road as it rounds a sharp switchback and returns. <br><br>Back on the road at mile 4.3, turn left and hike 0.5 mile to the east to find Mowich Lake. Once at the lakeshore, turn right and follow the road along the shoreline to a flat area at the end of the road. Tolmie Peak is visible to the north from here. To see Mount Rainier, hike 0.25 mile south to a viewpoint on the ridge above the lake. A small, level area for campers is nearby, with plenty of places for picnickers to plop down and enjoy lunch while gazing at the stony north face of the mighty mountain.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Easiest. <br>Generally good trails for beginners, with little elevation change and minimal avalanche danger.\n                 ",

Deer and mountain goats share this area, with the goats preferring the rocks and the meadows atop them and the deer favoring the meadows abutting the forests below the cliffs. A fine campsite is nestled in the trees near Spukwush Creek, with good views of the cliffs and the meadows.<br><br>Continuing on past the cliffs, the trail keeps climbing, now in the broad meadows, for another 1.5 miles to the U-shaped basin of Windy Gap (at 6.5 miles from the road end). Plant life is sparser here, with just a bit of heather and grasses pushing up through the rocks and around the edges of the many little tarns that dot the gap. A perpetual breeze blows through the gap (hence the name), but there&apos;s not much of a view. <br><br>If you have the time and inclination, an off-trail scramble is worthwhile here. Climb the rocky slope on the south side of the gap to attain the ridge crest above. Here, you can peer down to the west on the sapphire-blue waters of Crescent Lake and south to the emerald-green plain of the Elysian Fields. Towering above the fields is mighty Mount Rainier.\n                 ",

The raucous crowds are colonies of marmots. And the hair-raising air traffic? Gray jays, eagles, ravens, and hawks. The Seattle Park Trail starts in lush old-growth forest and climbs into some of the most spectacular parkland you&apos;ll find on the flanks of Mount Rainier. The area is rich in wildlife. Coyotes and bobcats hunt those marmots, as do enormous golden eagles. Mountain goats and black-tailed deer browse those meadows, and so to do lumbering black bears.

Particularly in early season, be aware that crossing running water is dangerous -- do not attempt this if the creek is running particularly high or if you do not feel comfortable doing so. <br><br>After you successfully (and safely) cross the creek, enjoy wildflowers galore -- hellebore, dogwood, bead lily, and munch on wild blackberries, strawberries, or thimbleberries, depending on the season. <br><br>As you hike, expect to see mountain bikers and horses, since the Suntop Trail is multi-use, but the half-mile trail to Doe Falls is open only to hikers, so you can expect a little more solitude once you reach the junction with the Doe Falls Trail -- 2.5 miles from your starting point. The short trail to the falls takes you through a shady forest and even more wildflowers. <br><br>The trail as it approaches Doe Falls is eroded, so use caution as you view it. Enjoy the spray coming off of the falls and swift-running Doe Creek. Have lunch here, or rejoin the folks heading to Suntop Lookout and enjoy expansive views of Rainier before heading back to your car.\n                 ",

Shrubbery includes thimbleberry, Cascade Oregon grape, lupine, and currant. The trail has a steady, mild grade, but it does not have a flat surface and has not been maintained with hikers in mind. Bring appropriate footwear to contend with loose dirt and sand. After one mile, come to an intersection with trail 1350.2, marked by a sign that bans ATVs and other four-wheeled vehicles. Veer left and continue gently upward for one more mile west-southwest to the intersection with the trail segment to Manastash Lake. Lost Lake, at 4840 feet, lies 0.1 mile beyond this intersection. The shores have several sites that are good for camping. <br><br>Double back to the Manastash Lake trail, and turn right (southeast) onto it, skirting the east shore of Lost Lake. Pass a talus field and weave in and out of the forest into clearings that offer views of Ellensburg&#x2019;s wind farms and the Stuart range. Deeper into this hike, the forest is dominated by Engelmann spruce, Douglas fir, and mountain hemlock. Before reaching Manastash Lake&#x2019;s basin at 5063 feet, descend briefly, then climb back up to a saddle: Manastash Lake is suddenly before you, clam and reflective. Hardhack, aster, fireweed, and buttercup bloom near the lake. Follow the trail around the lake&#x2019;s western perimeter to a hand-crafted two-person fishing bench, or simply bask in the riparian oasis atop Manastash Ridge.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: This is a great option in the shoulder season, especially springtime, when there is still too much snow for dirtbikers to make it up to the lake.</p>\n                 ",

The first mile or so is more or less flat, quickly transporting you to your first glimpses of snow-covered Mount Rainier. In just under 2 miles you&#x2019;ll reach the Deep Creek Trail 1196. Stay to the right, following the ridgeline as you turn north. You will parallel the Norse Peak Wilderness to the west before briefly entering it for a few moments 2.6 miles from the trailhead.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll know you went through the Wilderness when you encounter the junction with the Dalles Ridge Trail #1173 at three miles. Head right, staying on the Noble Knob Trail to the next junction in a tenth of a mile. Here the trail splits in three directions. Take the middle path straight up to the summit.<br><br>The views only improve. Catch glimpses of Lost Lake to the west, and Twentyeight Mile Lake to the east. Before you know it you will have reached the top and its 360-degree panoramas. Mount Rainier seems almost close enough to touch. Look north for your first view of George Lake in the meadow-filled cirque below you. Forested peaks spread out in every direction. Find a good place to settle in and enjoy the views.</p>\n                 ",

The trail rolls up through forest, across alpine meadows, and past a couple of fine little lakes before erupting onto a high, wind-swept ridge that is rich with views.<br><br>The trail initially follows a dirt road (a ski area service road), passing under a cluster of powerlines and then climbing through a broad clear-cut. The road gives way to trail as the route heads up the tree-studded ridge. You&apos;ll be in and out of trees, but mostly climbing in sun-drenched rock meadows.<br><br>At 3 miles you&apos;ll crest the ridge.

This alpine ramble leads through steep flower-filled meadows, over narrow ridge spines, and under shady forest canopies. Views sweep over the dry, pine valleys of the eastern Cascades, the glacier-covered summit of massive Mount Rainier, and the craggy peaks of the central Norse Peak Wilderness to the north. Best of all, despite the modest level of difficulty (not too long, nor too steep) the trail isn&apos;t heavily used, so it&apos;s possible to find a quiet place for a peaceful lunch high on the ridge.<br><br>The trail (No. 1156) climbs northwest away from the main ski lodge toward some cabins on the east wall of the valley. In just a few hundred yards, you&apos;ll encounter a dirt access road. Continue up this to the trailhead on left.<br><br>In the first 0.5 mile the trail climbs gradually through open forests and meadows as it slants northeast before switching back to head up the Bullion Creek valley into the heart of Bullion Basin. The basin, a flower-filled meadow in a shallow cirque, is reached in just less than 2 miles. After crossing the creek, the path enters a deep thicket of woods and then jumps back into the sunshine as it climbs steeply for 0.5 mile to reach the junction with the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) at 6300 feet.<br><br>Turning south on the PCT you&apos;ll follow the ridge down to Blue Bell Pass, around Crown Point, and through Pickhandle Gap in the next 2 miles to reach Bear Gap (elev. 5882 ft). These 2 miles are all well above tree line and offer constant views of the wildflower pastures at your feet and of the panoramic vistas beyond--each pass and peak has its own special view. From Bluebell, look east to Fifes Peaks. From Crown Point, look southwest to Mount Rainier. From Pickhandle, look southeast to American Ridge. From Bear Gap, look north to Norse Peak, south to Rainier, east to Fifes, and west to Crystal Mountain.<br><br>Leave the PCT at Bear Gap by taking the right fork at the four-way trail junction and head toward Hen Skin Lake on Trail No. 1163. A gentle descent of 200 feet in 0.75 mile leads to the shallow, muddy-bottomed pond. You&apos;ll find a junction with Crystal Mountain Loop coming in from the left. There are a few small trout swimming in the lake, but also a whole lot of mosquito larvae early in the summer--keep moving and most of the little biters will miss you.<br><br>Turn right at the lake onto Trail No. 1192 and make a long, slow descent into the ski area. In 2 miles you&apos;ll cross a creek near a couple of rustic cabins and burst out onto an open ski slope.

Many of them have long planks strapped to their backs as they ascend the steep trail. These are cross-over &#x2018;shoers. They use their shoes to get them to the top of steep, deep slopes and then trade their snowshoes for snowboards and swoosh down the smooth slopes. Even nonboarding snowshoers will appreciate the artistry these backcountry snowboarders exhibit on their downhill runs. But Bullion Basin has a lot more to offer than just the chance to watch some backcountry thrill seekers shred powder. This trail has high, subalpine meadows blanketed in deep snow, wonderful views of the surrounding craggy peaks, and an array of destination options to assure solitude for those who want it. The trail climbs steeply, and there are some serious avalanche slopes around the area, so snowshoers here need to be ready for a workout and must know how to recognize and avoid avalanche dangers. But when the conditions are stable, this is a wonderful winter world to explore and experience.<br><br>The route follows Trail 1156 east toward Blue Bell Pass. The trailhead is found to the east (left, as you face the ski slopes) side of the ski area parking lot behind the condominiums and buildings on the hillside. From the upper end of the parking lot, angle left up the steep slope, skirting the beginners&apos; ski slope at the base of the valley wall. Snowshoeing along the tree line, find an old roadway and more skier cabins. A small ski lift on the right ends near the road--stay well to the left of it to the first switchback on the narrow road. The trail sign should be visible at this switchback in all but the heaviest snow years.<br><br>Trail 1156 climbs left along a traverse across the slope to 5000 feet, and then switches back a few times before settling in for a long climb up the small Bullion Creek draw. If the trail is drifted over and difficult to find, simply pick a route along the north side of the creek and, in just over 1.5 miles, traverse right to cross the creek (near 5600 feet). Hike through a thin stand of forest, climbing straight up the slope above to reach the open meadows of Bullion Basin at 5800 feet.<br><br>Plenty of variations are available on the approach route, but generally, evaluate the slopes and find a path as near to the actual route of the summer hiking trail as possible while steering clear of the steep slide-prone slopes. Lots of open country is found along the way, so views are spectacular all the way up. From Bullion Basin enjoy views of the ski area as well as of the snowboarders playing nearby. If you are the adventurous sort, choose to scramble another mile (gaining some 600 feet) up steep slopes to the ridge crest at Blue Bell Pass. However, Bullion Basin is so pretty and scenic, there is really no need to go any higher in your explorations. Scramble around the basin to find a nice, quiet picnic spot, enjoy a leisurely meal, and then head back down.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Backcountry<br>These routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses. These routes require complete competence in winter survival skills, avalanche and snow condition evaluation and some basic mountaineering skills.\n                 ",

Perhaps that&apos;s partly because the trail you have to hike to get close to the jagged ridge can be menacing and imposing in its own right. Fortunately, the views are worth it--and not just the views at the end of the route. As you climb, the long, broad basin of American River and the sweeping line of American Ridge stretch out before you every time you gain a vantage point, while Fifes Peaks punctuate the skyline above you.<br><br>Start hiking up the dirt road, reaching an upper parking area (accessible only to high-clearance vehicles) in 0.25 mile. The trail starts here, crossing into the Norse Peak Wilderness just past the end of the road. The route follows Wash Creek upstream, meandering through a forest filled with vanilla leaf and Indian pipe. Wash Creek has lived up to its name, having washed out a section of the old trail, pushing the newer path up onto the low bench above the creekbed.<br><br>At about 1 mile the trail turns steep as it follows the now steeply pitched creekbed upvalley. You&apos;ll be sweating buckets even in the frequently dry environment of this heavily forested valley. The trail crosses the creek frequently, allowing you plenty of opportunities to cool yourself in the cold water.<br><br>Nearly 3 miles from the trailhead, the path climbs onto a low section of Fifes Ridge and turns east to ascend the ragged rocks of the upper section of the ridgeline. Just past the 3-mile mark you&apos;ll cross a rocky summit, affording you wonderful views west to the true summit of Fifes Peaks--vertical walls of rock shoot skyward to form the craggy mountain top. You can also look east along the ridge to view the rampartlike spires and towers of Fifes Ridge. Scan the treetops on the slopes below and you might spot the nests of local raptors.<br><br>You can stop at this viewpoint and enjoy the panorama over a leisurely lunch, or push on along the ridgetop trail, finding small meadows higher on the ridge.\n                 ",

No grand views or grand forest here - just miles of tranquil woods and creekside walking and some historic relics from the golden age of logging. Equestrians and mountain bikers share these trails, but crowding isn&apos;t an issue. Come during the week and have this place to yourself.<br><br>This loop begins by following the Mima Porter Trail (Trail No. 8) for 0.4 mile down to a junction in the Lost Valley Creek. The trail on your left is your return route. These trails are in excellent shape thanks to the volunteer work of the Backcountry Horsemen (and women) of Washington.<br><br>Head right on Trail No. 20. Climbing gradually, pass a few big firs, a lot of skunk cabbage, and an active beaver pond. In 1.4 miles come to a junction with Trail No. 6, the Green Line. Turn left and follow this good trail. Climb a bit more, and after crossing a logging road enter a mature second-growth forest. Begin a long descent into the Sherman Creek valley. At 2.6 miles emerge from the forest to cross a recent cut. Notice the temperature change. Notice Capitol Peak and Larch Mountain in front of you. Notice, too, that there are no larches on Larch Mountain. Hmm.<br><br>At 3.25 miles reach the lovely Sherman Creek valley, where you&apos;ll come to another trail junction. The trail right crosses the creek (bridge out as of summer 2006) and heads to the Fall Creek trailhead and onward to the Capitol Crest. You&apos;ll want to continue left on Trail No. 8 for an enjoyable journey down the valley. Plenty of lunch spots along the way will entice you to take a break.<br><br>After about 3 miles of hiking along the creek you&apos;ll come to an old trail junction. There used to be a trailhead on the other side of the creek, but it and the road no longer exist. This decommissioning has helped return a little solitude to this region. The trail now leaves Sherman Creek to follow Lost Valley Creek upstream. This is the best part of the loop. Under a canopy of moss-draped alders and big cedars, the trail uses an old logging railroad bed. After 1 mile of heading up Lost Valley Creek, look for trestle remnants. Look, too, along the creek for relics from the old logging days. Broken bricks and porcelain plates litter the area. Be sure to leave these artifacts for others to enjoy.<br><br>Hike about 1.5 more miles upstream back to the junction with Trail No. 20.

Then amble alongside a babbling creek to appreciate engineers past (those who conducted trains) and engineers present (furry ones who build dams).<br><br>Lake Sylvia State Park packs a lot of history, natural beauty, and recreation within its tight borders. Once an old logging camp, the area was converted into a park in 1936. The narrow lake was created by damming Sylvia Creek, first for rounding logs and then for providing Montesano&apos;s electricity. Plenty of artifacts and evidence remain in the park from its early days. But hikers will be pleasantly surprised to see how well the area&apos;s forests have recovered. Mature trees hover above the lake and creek, providing not only a pretty backdrop, but also some great wildlife habitat.<br><br>This hike consists of two loops originating from the same origin. Start out near the boat launch, hiking north along Lake Sylvia&apos;s west shore on a perfectly level path that once housed tracks for a logging railroad. No gasoline motors are allowed on the lake, providing paddlers and hikers a peaceful environment. Mature evergreens shade the trail while large alders drape over the tranquil waters. The northern end of the lake is marshy, providing good cover for ducks, geese, and herons.<br><br>In 1 mile you&apos;ll hit an old logging road. Turn right, cross Sylvia&apos;s inlet stream, and then turn right again to hike back along the lake&apos;s eastern shore. The return trail is wilder, climbing over bluffs and darting in and out of cool side ravines. You&apos;ll emerge in the park&apos;s attractive campground (a great weekend base). Walk the campground access road a short distance back to the entrance booth, cross the bridge, and return to your start.<br><br>Refill water bottles and head south along the lake for the second loop. Cross a cove on an old railroad bridge (now a beloved fishing spot) and head to the start of the Sylvia Creek Forestry Trail. Follow this 2-mile loop through adjacent City of Montesano City Forest. Along the creek and through cool forests of maple and cedar, keep an eye out for more evidence of past human activity (such as old springboard cuts and railroad trestles).

There&apos;s no reason that this 90,000-acre piece of the public domain can&apos;t be Olympia&apos;s Tiger Mountain. But the area has been long plagued by illegal dumping, shooting, and other problems, causing hikers to shy away. Motorized groups have adopted trails on their half of the forest, and equestrian groups work on nonmotorized trails, but where are the hiking groups? If hikers begin taking more of a vested interest in this forest-volunteering on trail crews, cleanups, and watches-the problems will dissipate. Capitol Forest is getting better, but it&apos;s going to take a lot of work from dedicated citizens and some better funding and management from the state to transform this parcel into what it should be-a prime hiking destination.<br><br>Contemplate this vision as you hike along the Capitol Crest, the rooftop of the Black Hills. From your high start (1880 feet) hike Trail No. 30 for about 0.3 mile to a junction. Turn right onto Trail No. 6, the Green Line. On very good tread begin a rolling ridgetop romp to Capitol Peak. After about 1.3 miles, cross the C Line that you drove in on.

Teaser views of the Cascades, Olympics, and Willapa Hills are had along the way.<br><br>At 2 miles you&apos;ll cross the C Line again, this time at its junction with the C-4000 Line on the left and the C-4010 Line on the right. The trail resumes a few hundred feet up the C-4010. Continue through more fir forests and shrubby openings. After 3 miles pass an old hitching point and then climb a little and drop a little through open forest with more peek-a-boo views. At 3.5 miles, cross another road. The trail, now paralleling two roads, climbs a small knoll above them only to descend where they meet up. Here, at 4 miles from your start, Trail No. 6 heads east, rapidly descending off the ridge.<br><br>This is the end of your trail hike. To access Capitol Peak, walk the road north a few hundred feet to a three-way junction. Take the gated middle road and climb steeply to the 2659-foot peak, second-highest summit in the Black Hills. Under a skyline of communication towers, reach out to sweeping views. To the east are the Cascades, from Mounts Baker to Adams. Rainier is directly in front of you, rising above the Bald Hills. Extending to the north are the finger peninsulas and inlets of the South Sound. To the west, the Satsop Towers rise above the Chehalis Valley, while the Olympics and Pacific Ocean can be seen in the distance. Soak it all in and retrace your steps.\n                 ",

This is the place to turn around and enjoy the long, scenic desert stroll back to your vehicle.<br><br>Note: Whiskey Dick Mountain is now a part of the Wild Horse Wind and Solar Facility. April-November you can drive the now paved Beacon Ridge Rd. to the Renewable Energy Center, located on the slopes of Whiskey Dick Mountain. From here you can fill out an access permit which is good for 8 months. Once you have this permit you can park in any of the five parking lots along Beacon Ridge Rd., and hike in the surrounding areas.

    "desc": "\n                    A sign-in permit is required due to the fact that the trail passes through the highly active U.S. Army&apos;s Yakima Training Center. You must not leave the trail. The John Wayne Trail (which rolls through the heart of the linear Iron Horse Trail State Park) follows the historic route of the Milwaukee Railroad from North Bend to the Columbia River (the trail will eventually be a true cross-state trail, but the stretch from the Columbia River to Idaho is still to be developed). This far eastern section of the completed trail explores some incredibly wild, pristine land--the designation of the surrounding lands as an Army training base actually helped preserve the area&apos;s wild beauty.<br><br>From the trailhead, a short path leads up to the ridge to the actual rail-trail. The permit sign-in box is located at the end of this path. Carry the permit with you, then put it in a drop box upon exit. The process is simple, free, and allows the Army to track usage by those wishing to hike this easement through their Yakima Training Center lands.<br><br>Once on the trail, you have a relatively flat, well-graded trail leading 4.5 miles to the old railway stop site of Boylston. The actual goal, though, is at the pass just east of that old rail stop: the Boylston Tunnel. The trail grade angles away from the freeway, taking you into the desert quiet. Within the first mile of trail, signs of local wildlife can be found. Badgers thrive here, as evidenced by a large system of burrows dug into the hills just off the trail. The burrows are easy to spot--just look for disturbed earth around dark holes. You can step off the trail and examine these since they are well within the 200-foot easement (staying off the restricted lands is easy since fences parallel both sides of the trail at a distance of 100 feet from the center line of the path).<br><br>Keep an eye on the sky as you walk: You&apos;ll likely see soaring red-tailed hawks, turkey vultures, and other raptors. Watch the ground around the trail, and you might see hares, rabbits, and other forms of dinner for the big birds. If the critters aren&apos;t showing themselves, simply enjoy the beautiful flora: Sage violets, yellow bells, cinquefoils, and phlox seem to be blooming for several months each spring and summer.<br><br>Near the end of the 4.5 miles, you&apos;ll see a large black void ahead. This is the tunnel door. As you draw nearer, feel the cold air rushing out--even in the heat of summer, the tunnel temperature stays down in the 50s.<br><br>The tunnel isn&apos;t a straight-through cut. A slight curve in the 1973-foot tunnel prevents those entering one end from seeing the other end. As a result, as you near the middle of the tunnel, the light at the entrance twinkles out, while the light from the exit slowly comes into view.<br><br>Caution: Do not enter the tunnel unless each person going in has a steady, dependable light source.\n                 ",

In  Of Men and Mountains, Douglas devotes a chapter to Jack Nelson and his wife Kitty, the first gatetenders of the Bumping Lake Dam (completed in 1913). The two made an excellent team and kept an eye on the lake for the next thirty years. Douglas would stop at their cabin as a young man and drink a cup of hot coffee before his own hikes along the trail and into the wilderness.<br>&#xA0;<br>Today the Bumping Lake trail still offers unique old-growth conifer stands, a range of wildlife from elk to wetland dragonflies, and a deep connection to Washington history.<br><br>The trail starts in woods near cabins and heads quickly down to the lake shore. After filling out a wilderness permit, stop to admire the views of Nelson Ridge across the lake&#x2019;s eastern end. <br><br>The trail then heads west, staying mostly above but near shore, traversing talus fields peppered with wildflowers. The hillside is steep in this first section, so access to the water is mostly visual. Look for large nests on the standing snags in the lake; the snags are remants of the former forest that stood here before the dam&#x2019;s construction. <br><br>At about 1.5 miles, ford Boulder Creek; a stout footlog is presently available. The trail continues through forest, and at 3 miles, crosses Cedar Creek by another ford. Immediately across the creek, pass a good forest campsite on the right. Along this level stretch of trail look for giant Douglas firs and towering larches. <br><br>Wildflowers, including wild strawberries and cow parsnip, line parts of the trail, along with red elderberry and blueberries. You also can&#x2019;t miss the spectacularly large anthills of the red ants, reaching 3 or more feet in height -- be careful of lingering too close to the piles of twigs and needles. <br><br>Soon the trail begins to climb gently, reaching the wilderness boundary and, shortly afterwards, the junction with the Swamp Lake Trail #970 at 4 miles. After this junction the trail descends to ford Cougar Creek. Use caution here early in the season (through roughly mid-July) when the water is high. <br><br>A quarter mile later the trail meets Fish Lake Way trail #971a. Here you have a range of options. Backtrack left along trail #971a for a short jaunt (.2 miles) to the Bumping River. Or, continue along trail #970 past meadows to Fish Lake (5.6 miles distant) and a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail.

The route climbs, steeply at times, along the Mesatchee Creek valley to the crest of the long, rambling American Ridge. You&apos;ll find great views from the wonderful alpine meadows lining the ridge top.<br><br><br>The trail starts up alongside the clear waters of the American River, following an old roadbed for the first mile. A footlog over the river at 1.2 miles marks the start of the workout, as the trail now turns away from the American River and angles up into the Mesatchee Creek valley.<br><br>At a trail junction in 0.25 mile, stay left--the right fork leads up the Rainier Fork American River to Dewey Lake. The left-hand path stays in the Mesatchee Valley but leaves the creek behind as it gets nasty-steep on a mile-long series of switchbacks heading up the valley wall. Before the creek passes from sight, though, you&apos;ll loop close to it on one turn and see a pretty horsetail waterfall cascading over a steep rocky rim.<br><br>Once well above the creek level, the trail moderates a bit and enters a long traverse of the slope, angling upstream before crossing the creek just short of the 4-mile mark. You&apos;ll find plenty of creekside rest areas if you need to take a break. But don&apos;t linger long--you&apos;ll want to push on, as there are prettier places to see and enjoy.<br><br>The trail moves farther up the creek valley and circles through the upper slopes of the meadow-filled basin at the head of the creek. At 5.2 miles the trail ends at a junction with American Ridge Trail amid a tangle of huckleberries and alpine firs.

The trail is good, despite a bit of steepness, a few roots, even a short section on very-weathered boardwalk. The route begins in shady sub-alpine forest, with only an occasional glimpse of Rainier through the trees.<br><br>After 1.3 miles and 1600 feet of elevation gain, come to a junction with the Crystal Peak Trail. The peak is a great viewpoint, but it&apos;s a steep 2.5 mile hike from the junction, with 1800 feet of elevation gain. So Crystal Peak might be a worthy destination for a different hike.<br><br>Climb a few more switchbacks and cross an old avalanche chute, less obvious in recent years, with its new growth. Soon, there is an opening through the trees and Mount Rainier comes into the fullest view you will have on this entire hike. It&apos;s a great photo-op, particularly in morning light. Farther up the trail, the mountain will disappear behind a shoulder of Crystal Peak, and if you hike on above Crystal Lake only the summit dome will reappear, not the entire mountain.<br><br>A mile past the Crystal Peak Trail junction, come to a signed T-junction. The left branch goes on to Crystal Lake, and the right branch to Lower Crystal Lake. If the lower lake is your goal, go for it. It&apos;s only 100 yards down to the designated camp area, which includes two sites plus a bear pole, and a few feet farther to the edge of Lower Crystal Lake. Even if your goal is the upper lake, you might want to take this 100-yard side trip. The lower lake is not visible from farther up the trail, so this will be your only chance to see it.<br><br>The lower lake is relatively small, with a dense growth of sedges around much of the shoreline. The lake is surrounded by small trees, and rocky peaks rise beyond the trees in the distance. It&apos;s a pleasant, peaceful spot to enjoy.<br><br>The trail continues on. The forest becomes more open and when in season, wildflowers bloom along the edges of the trail. Indian paintbrush, western anemone and lupine are common here, and you will find many others. After 0.7 miles from the T-junction, reach Crystal Lake itself. The designated camping area is off to the right, and offers several sites.<br><br>The upper lake is much larger than the lower lake, and it&apos;s in a dramatic setting in a basin walled by rugged peaks. Notice particularly Three Way Peak to the northeast. It has a small window through the rock formation, slightly to the right and a bit lower than the summit. Scan the peaks surrounding the lake for other interesting features. <br><br>You are only three miles from the trailhead so there&apos;s no need to hurry back. Take a leisurely walk around the shore of Crystal Lake and just relax and appreciate the beautiful setting. You might even find that you have company. It&apos;s not unusual to see mountain goats or elk in the vicinity.<br><br>Extending Your Hike<br><br>For many years there has been a trail that leaves Crystal Lake and climbs 600 feet in one mile, crossing the ridge east of the lake and meeting the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) just north of Sourdough Gap. Signs at the ridge top mark the park boundary and alert hikers coming from the PCT about park camping regulations, but do not mention Crystal Lakes specifically. Some earlier maps and guide books omit this trail, but it is shown on the Green Trails Mount Rainier Map (269S) and on some other recent maps.<br><br>To locate the trail up to Sourdough Gap, follow the shoreline trail around the north side of Crystal Lake about 0.1 mile. Come to an obvious Y where the right fork continues on around the lake shore. The left fork is the trail you want. It heads slightly uphill toward Three Way Peak, then climbs more steeply toward the northeast before bending back south and reaching the ridge top east of Crystal Lake. In season many wildflowers bloom along the way, and there are great views looking back down on Crystal Lake, with the summit of Mount Rainier showing in the distance. <br><br>From the ridge top, the trail continues on 100 yards, dropping a few feet to meet the PCT at a switchback. Continue south on the PCT an additional 200 yards to reach Sourdough Gap. Enjoy great views south to Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens and other high points, and down to Sheep Lake 600 feet below. For most hikers, the gap will be a good turn-around point.<br><br>The PCT continues on, dropping down and passing Sheep Lake, then crossing Highway 410 at Chinook Pass, 2.4 miles from Sourdough Gap. This suggests the possibility of arranging a car shuffle and doing an interesting through-hike, beginning at Chinook Pass and ending at the Crystal Lakes trailhead, or vice-versa.</p>\n                 ",

This hike was written up in the Mountaineers Book: Best of the Pacific Crest Trail Washington, Hike #24 (now out of print). This is a great intro to backpacking hike: Four days, 7 to 8 miles per day of &#x201C;relatively&#x201D; flat backpack packing. The trail is well marked, there are abundant camp sites and many stopping points along the way. This is a two-car hike; drop one car at Chinook Pass, drive approximately 45 minutes to White Pass and start hiking from there.  <br><br>It is strongly recommended that you go South to North for the following reasons:<br>1:  The scenery unfolds and becomes more spectacular each day. Initially wildflower meadows, bug ponds and small lakes evolve into beautiful crest vistas of the Goat Rocks, Mount St. Helens and Mt Rainer. Going southbound will have you wanting the car as opposed to enjoying the last day&#x2019;s majestic views.<br>2:  The sun won&#x2019;t be in your eyes.<br>3:  The climbs, such as there are, are on Day 3 and Day 4. <br><br>Here are the camp choices:<br>Day1:  White Pass to Sand Lake 3mi or Pipe Lake 7.5mi, Buesch Lake is at 6mi and recommended in the trail book, but we found the bugs intolerable. Your pick depending on starting time.<br>Day 2:  Fish Lake or Crag Lake <br>Day 3:  American Lake or Cougar Lake <br>Day 4: Out via Dewey Lake, to Chinook Pass\n                 ",

It&apos;s also one of the toughest, but the workout is well worth the effort. This section of the Wonderland Trail is also the highest of that entire 94-mile loop route. The section of trail leading up the Fryingpan Creek basin isn&apos;t all that spectacular, but once you get high, the beauty stacks up like cordwood until the sheer splendor of the route nearly overwhelms you. The wildflower meadows of Summerland are staggeringly beautiful. The rock and ice basin below Fryingpan Glacier is wonderful. Then you crest the last rocky ridge at Panhandle Gap and see the vast alpine world of Ohanapecosh Park stretched out to the south, with the spires of the Cowlitz Chimneys punctuating the eastern skyline and massive Mount Rainier towering over it all to the west. Chances are also good you&apos;ll see one of the large local herds of mountain goats either browsing or napping in one of the meadows or snowfields. <br><br>The trail climbs gradually for the first couple of miles, ascending the Fryingpan valley. Late in the season (late August and early September), you can find a few huckleberries in the sun-dappled forest along the first couple of miles of trail. At 2 miles out, the trail offers a view of the constricted waters of the creek as it pounds down a rocky chasm. The thundering waters can be near-deafening early in the year when snowmelt fills the river to near flood stage.<br><br>At 2.5 miles, the trail starts to traverse through a series of avalanche slopes. These avalanche chutes are largely full of slide alder, but the areas along their edges sport salmonberries and, at times, broad huckleberry brambles. At 3 miles, you find the largest avalanche chute. Here, the trail turns and crosses the creek before climbing steeply up the opposite valley wall. The creek crossing can be impossible early in the year--the long footlog typically has to be replaced each spring, and until crews get that done, there is no safe way across the churning water. <br><br>Once over the creek, the trail climbs steeply for 1 mile, then enters 0.25 mile of tight switchbacks before erupting out into the sprawling meadows of Summerland (5900 feet). A wonderful open backcountry camp is nestled on a small spine along the flank of Summerland meadows, and huge boulders provide plenty of warm places to lie out and rest in the sunshine. Hikers who have had their fill of scenic beauty (not to mention thigh-burning climbing) can turn back here for a wonderful 8.5-mile round trip. <br><br>The better option, though, is to push on. The next 2 miles ascend gradually. You climb the eastern wall of the Summerland basin and, at about 5 miles, enter a world of rock and ice (well, rock and compact snow). This basin below the Fryingpan Glacier is above the vegetation zone, so little grows here. Still, you&apos;ll see birds darting through the basin and possibly find mountain goats taking their leisure on the cool year-round snowfields.<br><br>At 6 miles, you top out of the last climb to find yourself on the narrow ridge of Panhandle Gap. Behind you is Summerland and Mount Rainier. Before you is the vast Ohanapecosh valley and the broad meadows that circle the head of that valley--meadows that form Ohanapecosh Park.\n                 ",

This pair of shallow forest lakes provides good water, lots of forage in the shoreline meadows, and wonderful cover in the forests that press in around the lakes. Hikers find limited views from the trail--though there are nice views up to Cowlitz Chimneys and Tamanos Mountain. But the forest environment this trail explores is unmatched for those who appreciate a rich woodland ecosystem. Kids and adults appreciate the wildlife-viewing potential. Birds and beasts (large and small) thrive in this forest, and birds fill the lakes basin. Repeated visits to the lakes have let me spot grouse, pileated woodpeckers, mountain blue jays, cedar waxwings, ospreys, bald eagles, golden eagles, tanagers, and a host of birds I couldn&apos;t identify. There&apos;s also a fair amount of huckleberries along the route if you time your trip just right.<br><br><br>Running south through lush old forest, the trail climbs steadily from the get-go. The initial climb starts with a 0.25-mile-long ascending traverse before swinging into a series of switchbacks. The rush upward continues over the first 2.5 miles as the trail runs up the northern spine of Tamanos Mountain. Listen for birdsong along this stretch, and keep your eyes open for small critters in the forests along the trail.<br><br>At 2.5 miles, the trail sweeps out into a hillside traverse, reaching Tamanos Creek Camp at 3 miles. The small namesake creek is a seasonal feeder of Shaw Creek, which drains Owyhigh Lakes. Tamanos Creek usually dries up by early September, so don&apos;t plan on camping here late in the season. <br><br>From the camp, the trail drops to a nearly flat pitch for the final 0.5 mile to the lakes basin. The shallow lakes are wonderful for cooling your feet--but not great for swimming. As you approach the lakes, stay quiet and keep a keen eye out for a moment in the forests and meadows around the lakes. You might see deer, elk, or even mountain goats--the goats descend from the craggy heights above to drink here. <br><br>Enjoy the views of the Cowlitz Chimneys above the lakes, and maybe doze in the sun-dappled meadows, before pushing on the final 0.5 mile to the 5400-foot pass separating Governors Ridge from Tamanos Mountain. The pass provides good views of each peak, as well as the high spires of the Chimneys to the west. Turn back here. Note: This trail was severely damaged in the November 2006 floods. As this book went to press, this trail was relocated through rough terrain. Check with the park for the current status of this trail.\n                 ",

This trail is the only one in the vast area between Huckleberry Creek and the White River, and it dead-ends at the lakes&apos; basin. As a result, this wild high country gets relatively few human visitors. The broad wildflower meadows that blanket the upper flanks of the Sourdough Mountains (from Dege Peak to Slide Mountain) attract deer, elk, and mountain goats. During one late September visit, my intrepid hiking companion and I found ourselves enjoying a spectacular sunset with views of the alpenglow on the Palisades--a tall band of cliffs above Palisades Lakes. As the orange glow faded on the rock wall, the haunting call of bull elk in the midst of their rut--mating season--echoed across the meadows. Soon, no fewer than six bulls were bugling their challenges, converging onto our evening retreat. Fortunately, the big males noticed that the band of cow elk had moved off to the west, and the amorous bulls veered that way before challenging each other in a clash of wills, each seeking the right to mate. Even without the elk encounter, however, the hike was memorable for the incredible scenery at the lakes. <br><br>From the parking lot, cross the road near the apex of the hairpin turn to find the trailhead on the north side of the roadway. The trail descends through some gentle switchbacks for 0.5 mile to a trail junction. Go right and follow the path as it meanders through stands of forests, small forest glades, and broad alpine meadows. <br><br>At 1.5 miles, the trail skirts the shore of Clover Lake (a fine place to turn back for those wanting a shorter hike). The trail continues north around a small rocky spine and rolls out into a wet hillside awash in wildflowers. The water that seeps out of the hillside keeps a wide variety of flowers in bloom much of the summer. At 2.5 miles, the trail runs between the trio of lakes known as Tom, Dick, and Harry. There&apos;s a small campsite on the shore of Dick Lake. <br><br>The trail climbs from Dick Lake Camp, entering thicker stands of forest but still offering plenty of sun breaks for the next mile, where the trail enters the cirque of Upper Palisades Lake. The trail descends in 0.25 mile to the shores of the lake. Camping is available at Palisades Lakes--permits are required. Broad meadows run along the south and east sides of the lake basin. The tall wall of the Palisades towers to the west.\n                 ",

From the summit, it&#x2019;s possible to see six (yes, six!) volcanoes spanning two states. Baker, Glacier, Adams, Rainier, St. Helens and Hood wait patiently for you to climb the more-than-moderately steep path to the summit of Crystal Peak, where you can take in beautiful snow-capped majesty from the top. <br><br>Begin at an unmarked trailhead on the left-hand side of Highway 410. The trail immediately crosses a delightful stream, which you&#x2019;ll be even more thankful for on the way down; it&#x2019;s a great spot to stop and dip your feet after four miles of relentless downhill. Cross the water using a footlog with a handrail, and get ready to climb. Quite a bit of elevation is gained in the first mile and a half, using switchbacks that zig zag through a less-than-inspiring second-growth forest. The best part about this section is the shade, and occasional peek-a-boo views of Rainier.<br><br>Reach a signed junction at the 1.5 mile mark, and take the right trail to Crystal Peak. It&#x2019;s counterintuitive, since the trail to the peak descends while the left-hand trail to Crystal Lake climbs, but don&#x2019;t worry, you&#x2019;ll make up that elevation loss, and then some. <br><br>This section is your only reprieve from near-constant uphill. You can enjoy the forest here, which becomes slightly more pastoral, with vanilla leaf and queens cup creating a green carpet under the trees. Break out onto a talus slope shortly after the junction and take in the views -- at the end of the slope you&#x2019;ll re-enter forest and resume your uphill trudge. <br><br>Continue through this forest for another mile, and finally begin hiking through lush green meadows. From here on out you have uninterrupted views of Rainier, and closer to hand, a plethora of wildflowers. Beargrass, tiger lilies, lupine, phlox, even magenta indian paintbrush (endemic to Mount Rainier National Park) accompany you on your climb. <br><br>And climb you will. As you complete several long switchbacks across the south-facing slope, your view is ever-changing. St. Helens is the first to come into view, then Hood. Glacier and Baker appear at a west-facing rocky outcropping just short of the summit with evidence of the lookout that used to sit atop Crystal Peak. Turn around here and see Adams looming at you to the east. The last push to the summit is quite steep, but thankfully quite short, where you can take in all six peaks, as well as Crystal Lakes far below you. <br><br>Crystal Mountain and Sourdough Gap are to the north, while the Cowlitz Chimneys and Shriner Peak are southeast-facing landmarks.

It&#x2019;s certainly the shortest route to the peak, but seems relentless, requiring strong hooves and the energy of a mountain goat.<br><br>The trail leaves the parking lot and immediately begins its uphill climb on a narrow path which travels through forest and alongside a small creek. Within the first mile, it leaves the creek and begins a traverse eastward where the trail becomes even narrower as it crosses a dry hillside. <br><br>Luckily, it is on hillsides like this where flowers of all varieties are delicately sprinkled amongst rocks. Purple and pink varieties of penstemon provide a welcome distraction along the steep trail. Angling into the ridge the route offers some views of the surrounding hills, then switchbacks a few times before contouring with the ridgeline as it climbs closer to its goal. Before you pass another mile, the trail swings eastward to a rocky overlook for your first full view of Fife&#x2019;s Peak.<br><br>The trail travels just below the crest of the ridge through areas of forest, huckleberry bushes, and along steep hillsides of rock covered only by a thin layer of dirt. These areas require an attentive step and a close eye. Looking up the trail one cannot help but recognize there are no stretches of flat pathway as it continues through more forest and shrubbery. <br><br>Near 2.8 miles, the trail alters its uphill course eastward across a talus slope just before meeting its intersection with the American Ridge Trail 958. Turn right and follow the obvious path through a final few switchbacks under the welcome shade of tree cover. Before long, the trail breaks out into an open, rocky hillside switchbacking up to the crest of American Ridge. <br><br>At a landing just below the high point, the trail continues westward along the American Ridge, providing alternate ways to ascend or descend from this peak.

It is possible to climb to the top of the peak, but the approach on the American Ridge Trail is exposed and heavily corniced at times. It is better to just enjoy the stunning views from the ridge crest at the top of the trail and leave the summiting for a summertime outing.<br><br>From the top of American Ridge, the views are outstanding.

Climb through a meadow to a junction with the Sourdough Ridge Trail, where you head left (east) toward Frozen Lake. At Frozen Lake follow the signs for the Wonderland Trail westbound. At 3.1 miles from the trailhead crest the ridgeline for Skyscraper Pass, where Mount Rainier looks so close you could touch it. Descend from Skyscraper Pass into the trees and at 4.4 miles reach Granite Creek wilderness camp.

The results of the floods of 2006 make dead trees look like a porcupine&#x2019;s back on the hillsides.

Besides the floral displays in early summer, the wildlife seen atop this summit is a treat. Goats wander the hillsides, and chipmunks, marmots and pika skitter amongst the rocks, along the trail and atop each of the three &#x201C;peaks&#x201D; which define this long, tundra-like alpine mountain.<br><br>The trail can be accessed from the northwest corner of the Sunrise parking lot. Note that despite warm weather in the parking lot, there is often a snowfield into the early summer on the approach to First Burroughs. Assess the situation and use great caution with steep snow travel. If you feel unsure about the crossing, save the hike for later in the season. <br><br>Follow the signs to the top of Sourdough Ridge on a wide, often dusty trail. The trail heads steadily uphill, gaining 400 feet in just over half a mile. The way is well-marked and heads west to a five-way intersection at Frozen Lake. From here, follow the Burroughs Mountain Trail at it makes its way uphill to the southwest on a relatively steep stretch of trail, reaching the broad, open top of First Burroughs Mountain at roughly 7000 feet. <br><br>Continue past an intersection to Second Burroughs, climbing an additional 400 feet in about half a mile. Second Burroughs offers impressive views into the Glacier Basin below, pointed Little Tahoma on a ridge of Rainier to the south, and expansive views of the park to the north, including Fremont Lookout, Berkeley and Grand Parks, and Skyscraper Mountain. With the elevation gain and mileage, Second Burroughs is a good turnaround point for most day hikers. But those after a bigger adventure can continue downhill to a saddle and intersection with the Glacier Basin trail. <br><br>Stay on the trail which veers slightly right and climbs the bench that eventually leads to the high point: Third Burroughs Mountain. Extra effort is required to reach the 7800 foot rocky top, but the reward is the invigorating feeling of being so close to Mount Rainier that you could reach out and touch it.<br>Stay a while on the top of Third Burroughs. There are plenty of big, flat rocks on which to sit and listen to the sounds of rock fall and the groaning mountain. Peek over the edge to the west and count the crevasses in the Winthrop Glacier formed along the contour of this volcano. Study the Inter Glacier for tiny climbers making their way to Camp Schurman and the eventual summit. Enjoy the views; they are stunning!</p>\n                 ",

Even if no other human hikers scale the Skyscraper, you&apos;ll find the local residents are typical nosy neighbors who have to check out any visitor. A small colony of marmots resides atop this peak, and I&apos;ve yet to visit the top without having one of the big yellow-bellied beasts popping out to check on my lunch. Enjoy visiting with the big beggars, but don&apos;t share your food: the marmots don&apos;t need your granola, and feeding them just encourages unneighborly behaviors on their part.<br><br>With the plethora of trails leading out of Sunrise, you have multiple options for getting onto this route, but the best bet is to scale Sourdough Ridge right off the bat.

These stands of bright white trees can be found throughout the Pacific Northwest, thanks to the ever-present threat of wildfire. The silver forests are the standing skeletons of trees that were lashed by fast-moving, intensely hot forest fires. When the fires are hot enough and moving fast enough, they kill the trees and scorch many of the limbs and bark off but don&apos;t devour the entire trunk. As a result, entire forests are left standing, though they are dead and stripped of their &quot;skin.&quot; Within a couple of years, the standing trunks are bleached white by exposure to the sun and wind, resulting in a shadowy stand of gray ghosts: the silver forest. When one of these shining woods is seen against a backdrop of emerald green meadows, brilliant blue skies, and a massive white mountain, the effect is amazing. You&apos;d never think a dead forest could look so beautiful and vibrant. But that&apos;s just what you&apos;ll find here.<br><br>From the trailhead, locate the trail on the south side of the parking area and head south.

This glimmering wood is the remnant of the Sunrise wildfire that flashed through the area many years ago. <br><br>The trail ends at 1.2 miles on a knoll at the end of the Yakima Park ridge, high above the White River valley.

Once over the railroad route, enter the L. T. Murray State Wildlife Recreation Area. The trail meanders through a broad sagebrush flat for 0.5 mile or so before crossing an old fence line (a few rotten posts and a low mound of dirt are about all that remains of the fence). Around this old homestead site you&apos;ll see the remnants of an old cabin--mostly just its rock foundation and a scraggly grove of apple trees.<br><br>That&apos;s the last real imprint of humans in this wild canyon. Various species of sage provide texture and fragrance to the canyon floor, while the canyon walls tower overhead.<br><br>Visit in winter and you might find a dusting of snow (possibly a few inches). A thin blanket of snow is actually a benefit to hikers as it serves as a tapestry on which the comings and goings of the local population are recorded. If you find snow, you&apos;ll also find tracks left by deer, bighorns, coyotes, small mammals, and game birds. The creek is the only water source for miles around, and it&apos;s easy to see the pathways of animals that come down from the canyon rim to get water.<br><br>The trail crosses the creek at about 1 mile. The crossing is typically an easy rock-hop, though at times you&apos;ll be forced to find a shallow spot between beaver ponds--or to carefully cross on a beaver dam. Extensive beaver activity is visible on this small desert creek. Some dams (made primarily from the local aspen, cottonwood, and alder) stand 6 to 8 feet tall, creating ponds that stretch several dozen yards upstream. Frequently the dams are built back to back with a new one standing at the upper edge of the lower dam&apos;s pond.<br><br>About 2 miles up the trail, the trail skirts around a stand of low alder. On several visits to the area, we&apos;ve encountered a portion of the resident herd of bighorn sheep (usually numbering 50 or 60 animals) either bedded down in this area or vacating their beds. The alder grove apparently provides good shelter for them on cold winter nights.<br><br>The trail continues up the canyon, but past the 3-mile mark it becomes narrow and largely overgrown and many creek crossings are needed. Rather than push on through the brush, turn around here and return through the rich canyon, remembering that you will find plenty to see on your way back.\n                 ",

Look downstream to catch a glimpse of the roadway below Christine Falls. The falls (not visible from above) were named for the daughter of Philemon Beecher Van Trump. Who?  P.B. Van Trump and his partner Hazard Stevens, are credited with the first ascent of Mount Rainier in August 1870. See the note below for more information about this historic climb of Washington&apos;s highest peak.<br><br>Follow Van Trump Creek upstream, as it roars through a narrow gorge with numerous cascades and small waterfalls. At 1.6 miles, round a corner to see a striking three-tiered waterfall: Bloucher Falls. Cross the footlog, then go left below the bank to rejoin the trail, which soon after provides the first clear view of Comet Falls. At 1.9 miles and 4875 feet, a side path to the left approaches the 392 foot falls.<br><br>To continue, go right and begin ascending steeply. Gain 650 feet in 0.6 mile to arrive at a junction, often buried under several feet of snow into July. Go right and climb to a green meadow which provides glimpses of Mount Rainier - a teaser for what&#x2019;s ahead. At 0.3 mile from the junction, a sign marks the end of the maintained trail at 5850 feet. Views to the south include Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens. Walk a short distance of unmaintained trail to drink in beautiful views of Mount Rainier from a vast green meadow.<br><br>To reach Mildred Point, walk 0.3 mile back to the junction, then go right and drop 200 feet to a crossing of Van Trump Creek. Admire Upper Comet Falls upstream, then gaze over the top of Comet Falls on your way to another junction, 0.5 mile from the previous one. Take a right; the final half mile leads you along a trail that gets narrow, steep, rutted, and overgrown, but passes gorgeous wildflowers. 3.5 miles from the trailhead is Mildred Point, a bluff at 5900 feet overlooking the vast and rocky Kautz Creek valley, with unobstructed views of Mount Rainier. Enjoy the surreal volcanic rock formations, the steepness of the terrain, and the contrast between the gray rocks here and the green of Van Trump Park to the east.<br><br>Note: Stevens and Van Trump probably did not stand on the true summit of Mount Rainier, but they are credited with the first ascent, two months ahead of geologists Samuel Emmons and Allen Wilson. That is why the names Van Trump and Stevens are attached to numerous features in Mount Rainier National Park.<br><br>A Yakima Indian named Sluiskin guided Stevens and Van Trump up the Muir snowfield to 9200 feet, but refused to go higher. Other native guides had similarly stopped short of the summit, largely because of Sluiskin&#x2019;s grandfather, who decades earlier had climbed the highest of any native on Takhoma (Mount Rainier). He had not summited, and strongly advised against it, reporting that Takhoma was inhabited by an evil spirit who dwelt in a fiery lake on its summit.<br><br>(Source: &#x201C;The Stevens and Van Trump Ascent of Mount Rainier, August 1870&#x201D;, Northwest Discovery - The Journal of Northwest History and Natural History, Northwest Press.)<br><br>Van Trump Park was not along the First Ascent route. A monument to the climbers along their actual route can be found by hiking the Skyline Trail from Paradise to Sluiskin Falls, which they named for their guide.</p>\n                 ",

Countless opportunities for snowshoeing can be found in the open areas of Paradise, but heading up toward Panorama Point is the best of the bunch.<br><br>From the west edge of the parking lot, snowshoe up the steep meadow behind the guide service building, skirt around the left side of the groomed-snow play area, and hike north along the west side of the tree-covered crown of Alta Vista peak. The route rolls uphill through meadows and thin tree cover, with excellent views of the mountain when the weather is clear. <br><br>From the small saddle on the north side of Alta Vista, climb along the prominent ridge crest as it leads straight toward Mount Rainier. The route parallels the massive finger of Nisqually Glacier, and at 1.5 miles, crosses a flat bench aptly named Glacier Vista. This is the best place to find a panoramic view of the sprawling glacier as it stretches from high on the flank of the mountain nearly to the Road to Paradise. If you are tired from the relentless climbing, turn back here knowing you have experienced some of the best views of the route; or catch your breath while soaking in the scenery, and then continue up to Panorama Point.<br><br>From Glacier Vista, the route climbs steeply northeast through open hillside meadows (with a few thin stands of wind-savaged alpine trees) to another broad bench nearly 1 mile farther up the mountain. (The distance varies from 0.6 to 1 mile, depending on how steeply you climb.) <br><br>Panorama Point lives up to its name, with grand views of the mighty mountain, its lower flanks, and the serrated ridge line of the Tatoosh Range to the south. On clear, cold days, the rocky spires of the Goat Rocks Wilderness Area as well as the perfect cone of Mount Adams are visible to the southeast.<br><br>To return to Paradise, head east across the bench of Panorama Point and descend the wide open slopes of the upper Edith Creek basin. The basin is wide and you can pick your own path once you enter it, but use caution when making the first drop into the basin. For the safest route, hike southeast no less than 0.5 mile from Panorama Point to skirt out and around the steepest slopes, which are always heavily corniced. Once past the obvious cornices and steep drops, head down the slope along Edith Creek and follow it all the way down to Paradise, passing under Alta Vista and entering the upper Paradise Valley to approach the Paradise Lodge and parking area from the east.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Most Difficult<br>Hikers should have good experience and familiarity with snowshoes. This route features sections that will need to be evaluated for avalanche safety every time. Trails climb considerably and may include climbing to ridge tops.

From here, you get a close-up view that few visitors to the park ever see: hanging glaciers, towering seracs, yawning crevasses, and thundering rockfall as the ridges of ash and breccia high above melt and crumble in the heat of the sun. <br><br>For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. <br><br>The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows. Used as a golf course in the 1930&#x2019;s and then as a ski area until the 1970&#x2019;s, the meadows have been under restoration for the last three decades and likely will be for the indefinite future -&#x2013; a testament to the fragile ecosystem that exists at this already high altitude. In this early section, it is not uncommon to see marmots and deer, as well as the occasional ptarmigan, fox, or even bear. <br><br>From the stairs behind the visitors center, follow the Skyline Trail past Glacier Vista and through a hairpin switchback. Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -&#x2013; a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. <br><br>Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer &#x2013;- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.<br><br>As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. <br><br>Two stone structures at either end of the saddle &#x2013; one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir&#x2019;s history stretches back even further - once known as &#x201C;Cloud Camp,&#x201D; it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party&#x2019;s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier. Bring a GPS device or download compass bearings from the park website as a backup. <br><br>Such contingencies show that the dividing line between day-hiking and alpine conditions is blurred here, yet another way this hike takes you into truly rarefied air, more than halfway up the tallest peak in Washington.</p>\n                 ",

Virtually every climbing party that heads up from Paradise passes through Camp Muir. But you don&apos;t have to be summit bound to enjoy a trip to the camp. And you don&apos;t have to camp to visit the camp. The route to Camp Muir is long, strenuous, and very susceptible to poor weather. But it can also be incredibly beautiful, with views that can&apos;t be found anywhere else. When the skies are clear and the snow is firm, snowshoers can slog up the long, steep slopes, pausing whenever they need a breather and enjoy endless views south. Mount Adams can be seen beyond the Goat Rocks peaks. Mount St. Helens can be seen on the far side of the Tatoosh Range. Far to the south, Mount Hood stands, and beyond it, far down in central Oregon, Mount Jefferson can sometimes be seen on the hazy horizon.<br><br>This long climb is best done late in the winter or better yet, in the spring, when the days are longer so you&apos;ll have extra daylight hours to make the long plodding climb. The route should also be reserved for days when the weather forecast calls for clear, stable weather. The long, barren slopes all clad in white can be extremely confusing and dangerous when the clouds blow in. The trek here should be considered an alpine mountaineering experience rather than just a stroll in the snow.<br><br>From the western side of the parking area, start up through the meadows, following the route to Panorama Point (Route 87). Snowshoe up past the groomed sliding areas populated by families with inner tubes, and continue around the west side of Alta Vista, plodding up the long slope to Panorama Point. Here, you&apos;re nearly half way to the camp. Before heading onward and upward, stop and enjoy the views--look south to The Castle, Pinnacle Peak, and Denman Peak in the heart of the Tatoosh Range. You can also see the long, craggy line of the Goat Rocks peaks leading south to Mount Adams. To the southeast, look for the abbreviated top of Mount St. Helens.<br><br>From Panorama Point, your route continues north, climbing through the Pebble Creek valley (7200 feet) a bit more than 1 mile from the point. In the valley, you&apos;ll find some big drifts that need to be crossed. Be careful with these drifts--some can be 20 or more feet tall and corniced at the top. <br><br>Beyond Pebble Creek, you enter the Muir Snowfield and the long, straight shot over the final miles and the last 2800 feet of elevation. You&apos;ll see the knob of McClure Rock on your right just after crossing Pebble Creek, and as you approach 9000 feet, you&apos;ll see the iron-hard frame of Anvil Rock. The last 0.5 mile, covering nearly 900 feet of elevation, makes you work for that final goal of reaching Camp Muir. <br><br>At the camp, though, you can rest and relax. If you&apos;re staying, you can relax for as long as you like. (Check with the ranger before heading up the mountain if you want to stay at Camp Muir. You&apos;ll need an overnight permit.) If you&apos;re day tripping, don&apos;t relax too long--you have a long slog back down the slope before nightfall.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Most Difficult<br>Hikers should have good experience and familiarity with snowshoes.

Lock up your bike if you brought it, as it is permitted only on the road. A sign indicates that this trail is not maintained due to numerous washouts in recent years; however, it is still navigable thanks to markers and cairns leading the way. Hike up the trail for 2.1 miles, pass a small waterfall and join the Wonderland Trail.<br><br>Head north on the Wonderland on a gentle, forested ascent.  The trail turns from dust to pebbles, and the scenery moves from forest to volcanic and subalpine terrain. As you approach Emerald Ridge you&#x2019;ll discover the reason for its name&#x2014;the wildflowers and grasses make this high alpine meadow a vision in green and offer visitors a wonderful packs-off opportunity to sit and take it all in. Aster, harebell and western anemone thrive in the volcanic earth, while the odd view of The Mountain from this angle makes it seem decrepit, fragile and ancient.  <br><br>The descent from Emerald Ridge is arguably the loosest rock footing on the whole trail, so go slow and use caution. In the next 1.5 miles the volcanic rock gives way to more forested canopy. Turn west on the South Puyallup Trail, watching for some interesting andesite columns, named the Colonnades. Continue descending through shrubs and thimbleberry, choreographed to the rumbling song of the South Puyallup River. At the next junction divert onto the Round Pass Trail and climb through woods for 0.6 mile to reach the Westside Road and the top of Round Pass.<br>  <br>Spot a stone memorial dedicated to a group of Marines whose plane went down on South Tahoma Glacier. Turn south on the road for the 2-mile descent to the Tahoma Creek Trail, grab your bike or walk back to your vehicle, and celebrate a wonderful day! <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Get intimate views of The Mountain, including Pyramid Peak, Glacier Island and the Sunset Amphitheater.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    Kautz Creek offers not only an excellent snowshoe excursion but also a chance to experience the geologic history of Mount Rainier. The trail climbs along the route followed by mudflows, lahars, and floods that date back tens of thousands of years. Lest one think that is all ancient history, bear in mind that the last massive mudflow in this valley occurred in 1947 when some 50 million cubic yards of mud, water, and debris flashed through the valley, burying the Road to Paradise and killing most of the trees in the lower valley bottom. A forest of silver snags is what remains today. But the picture isn&apos;t all that bleak. Although the valley is routinely the scene of geologic destruction, the area is awash in beauty between those catastrophic events. This route follows the tumultuous creek, then climbs through ancient forests, and finally rolls through wide, open meadows with spectacular views.<br><br>The trail is wide and easy to follow. The early section may be thinly covered in snow some years, so you might have to begin the outing with your snowshoes attached to your pack instead of your feet. However, the trail climbs steadily, and the snow is generally deep enough to require snowshoes well before the footbridge is reached at the 1-mile mark. Check with a ranger before heading out in early spring to make sure this bridge is intact: spring floods sometimes wash it away. Exercise caution when crossing the bridge. The snow accumulated on it tends to pile up at an angle, so the first person across should take his or her time and kick out good, solid footpads for those following. It may be necessary to remove your snowshoes to increase your stability when crossing. <br><br>Once over the creek, the trail begins to climb the valley wall, angling up through the forest between Tumtum Peak and Satulick Mountain. You can catch occasional peeks at these summits as you climb. The climb begins as a gradual straight-on pitch, and then turns into steep switchbacks. Around the 4000-foot level, the trail swings into a long hillside traverse around the head of a small creek valley (a tributary to Pyramid Creek), followed by another series of switchbacks.<br><br>At 4 miles from your car, the route enters the first long, broad meadow. Views south to the Kautz Valley and north to the glacier-covered flank of Mount Rainier are found here. This makes an excellent place to have lunch and turn around. If you prefer an extended adventure, carefully climb through the meadow and a tricky traverse through another clearing in the next mile before finding a long 0.5-mile traverse around the flank of Mount Ararat to reach the beginning of Indian Henry&apos;s Hunting Ground.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope.\n                 ",

Once a few cold nights have thinned the biting population, you&apos;ll be able to enjoy unmatched wilderness rambling among sprawling meadows and potholes. You&apos;re in the home range of elk here--and black bear territory too. This hike is a good introduction to the nearly infinite array of loops possible in the William O. Douglas, passing by the dual pools of Twin Lakes, under the shadow of Tumac Mountain&apos;s cratered volcanic summit, around Blankenship Lakes, through the sprawling Blankenship Meadows, and, of course, across the heart of Mosquito Valley.<br><br><br>The trail climbs modestly from the trailhead, following around the snout of a low ridge to reach the first of the Twin Lakes in about 2 miles. The forest along this early section of trail holds a good population of squirrels--you might catch a glimpse of them leaping from tree to tree. Also listen for the head-banging hammering of woodpeckers as they search for insects in the many dead snags.<br><br>Move on from the picturesque shores--enjoy a view over the little Twin Sister to Tumac Mountain--and follow the trail as it leads south toward Tumac. About 0.5 mile after reaching the second lake&apos;s shore, the trail splits. To the right is a track that leads to the summit of Tumac Mountain. Stay left and skirt southeast around the flank of the cinder cone. In another 0.25 mile reach another junction. This is the start of a loop. Stay right to complete the loop in a counterclockwise direction.<br><br>Hike nearly 1 mile south along this trail as it rolls gradually upward through thin forest and scattered clearings before reaching the long, broad meadows of Mosquito Valley. At about 3.5 miles from the trailhead you&apos;ll find yet another trail junction--trails crisscross the William O. Douglas Wilderness like strands of a spider web, making for seemingly endless loop-hiking alternatives.<br><br>Turn left and amble east through the cluster of Blankenship Lakes. Past the lakes, turn left at yet another junction. This leads along the eastern fringe of Blankenship Meadows, which stretch thousands of acres west and north, broken only by occasional narrow bands of forest.

Douglas Wilderness day hikes, especially for parents with children. The first of the twins is only about 2 miles down a moderately climbing trail, so plenty of people make their way there.

You want to hit the trail after the route is completely snow-free, but before the heat of summer bakes the trail (and any trail travelers) to a crisp. Or you can try it in au-tumn, though you&apos;ll run the risk of being caught out in an eastern Cascades thunderstorm. Realistically, if you hike in June or Sep-tember you&apos;ll be well served most years. Trail conditions aside, this route requires some serious stamina. It gains 4200 vertical feet in about 5 miles. The rewards are great--outstanding views, clean air, and relatively few people to share the trail with--but they come at a substantial price in lung and leg pain. Be prepared to work for every view you get.<br><br>&quot;From the trailhead you&apos;ll start upward immediately. The trail climbs through a pine forest, so at least initially you&apos;re out of the sun during the workout. This lasts for just over 2 miles, then the closed forest canopy starts to give way to more open alpine forest with a lot of meadows and clearings between timber stands. The trail also gets steeper, running up through switchbacks until, at 3.7 miles, it levels for a few paces atop a bench (elev. 6400 ft). Take a breather to enjoy the stunning views, especially to the south (Mount Adams and the jagged teeth of the Goat Rocks) and the west (Mount Rainier). Just beyond this, at around 5 miles, you&apos;ll conquer the ridge, rolling out onto its crest to join the Nelson Ridge Trail. But though you&apos;ve reached the ridge spine, the spine is steeply slanted and the trail now climbs once more through alpine meadows and scraggly tree stands. You&apos;ll soon find yourself scrambling the final mile to the top of Mount Aix. The last rocky run will tax your strength and endurance, but finally you&apos;ll be at the 7766-foot summit with its outstanding 360-degree views. Take a good long rest before starting the knee-grinding descent back down the ruthless trail.&quot;\n                 ",

Autumn isn&apos;t the only time to visit, of course. Though you may not hear the elk in the summer, you might very well see them in the forest and meadows along Bumping River. This hike is a less-intense outing than some of the higher alpine trails, following an easy grade along the river drainage and gradually gaining elevation into the valley&apos;s upper reaches south of Crag Mountain.<br><br>Start out with a 0.5-mile hike along a level track to the edge of Bumping River. Then--after stripping off your boots and socks--ford the river. Early in the year, when the snowpack is at full melt stage, the river can be deep and difficult to wade.

Tum-bling water draining from a trio of lakes. It seems the namer of the fea-tures of this route started with a good creative streak and then got lazy. Laughingwater Creek is a beautiful stream tumbling through a moss-laden forest, and Three Lakes is a wonderful trio of tarns in a high alpine basin; they deserve a livelier name. This trail is a marvelous route to explore early--it&apos;s usually snow free by late June or early July. Visit while the waters are still running strong to hear the biggest chuckles.<br><br>You start parallel to the creek but well back from the water&apos;s edge. The trail climbs moderately before angling across the slope to intercept the creek at 1 mile. A small picnic area has been stomped out here, alongside the Laughingwater, and many casual hikers call it a day here.<br><br>Push on, moving onward and upward--the best is yet to come. The trail continues its gradual ascent until it crosses a tributary to the Laughingwater at 3.5 miles. From this point, the trail gets more serious, turning steeply upward. The path climbs away from the creek as it ascends the headwall of the creek valley, passing faint way trails on either side in the upper basin.<br><br>You crest a small ridge at 4.5 miles and then drop slightly before running up into the Three Lakes Basin at 5.5 miles. The trail skirts around and be-tween the lakes to a backcountry camp at 6 miles. Find a place to kick back and relax around the lakes before heading back down.\n                 ",

You&apos;ll also find an array of birds and animals--swallows, swifts, bluebirds, chukars, quails, magpies, partridges, hawks, and eagles grace the sky while deer, elk, bighorn sheep, coyotes, rock chucks (marmots), badgers, hares, and an army of other small mammals roam the desert floor.<br><br>While an official trail leads up a broad ravine from the trailhead, a better hiking option is to park 0.5 mile short of the trailhead area and climb the open grass slopes toward the ridge top to experience the desert environment more directly. This route puts you among the plants and animals--it&apos;s literally a stroll in a wild garden. What&apos;s more, you&apos;ll find it impossible to get lost doing this. The open terrain and gentle slope ensure that the road and your vehicle are in sight for the entire first mile of your trek to the ridge top. Once at the top of the slope, you&apos;ll notice the far side of the ridge drops off in a steep cliff down to the Yakima River.

Journey out as far as you like before returning. (You can also head south on the trail along the rim.)<br><br>As the flowers color the landscape, they also perfume the air. Sage provides a constant, steady background on the wind, but as the warm sun heats the new plant growth, an intoxicating blend of scents awaits you. The air itself becomes a veritable stew of aromas as the ever-present sage is joined by the pungent odors wafting from the leaves of wild parsleys and onions.

The trail follows the south side of the river from the Oak Creek Wildlife Area Visitor Center to FS Rd 512 with two access points from Hwy 12 along the way: a suspension bridge at the Quonset hut 1.3 miles west of the Visitor Center and a footbridge at the west end of a large pullout 3 miles from the Visitor Center. <br><br>Along the way you&apos;ll enjoy a ramble along the river, impressive geologic formations, and relative solitude. The trail is best walked in the spring for wildflowers and in the fall for some of the most spectacular fall color you&#x2019;ll ever see. It&#x2019;s also a nice snowshoe or cross-country ski in the winter when there is snow on the ground. <br><br>From the Visitor Center, cross the highway, take the bridge across the river, and turn right through the gate in the elk fence. Inhale the heady scent of multiple wildflowers if they&apos;re out, and take note of the Garry oak trees with woodpeckers perched in them. Be wary of ticks and rattlesnakes as you hike, but don&apos;t let your awareness distract you from enjoying the beautiful flowers and views of the river that keep you company on this gently graded trail.  <br><br>The first 1.8 miles of the trail to the suspension bridge winds through sagebrush flats below the spectacular Royal Columns, dramatic cliffs of columnar andesite popular with local rock climbers. If scaling basalt walls isn&apos;t on your schedule, continue on the path that parallels the river, passing more signs that indicate some of the climbing routes on the cliffs. These are closed seasonally for nesting birds of prey. <br><br>From the suspension bridge, the trail makes its way up and down through the flood plain, immersed in the lush riparian vegetation of cottonwoods, aspens, garry oaks, willows, red-osier dogwood, and wild rose. After about a mile the trail enters a large meadow with a couple of big ponderosa pines and a giant oak tree in the middle. After crossing the meadow, the trail climbs a little and then cuts across the hillside directly above the river to the upper footbridge. <br><br>From the footbridge the trail continues to contour above the food plain for another mile or so to a large, flat peninsula with nice views up and down the Tieton River Canyon. This makes a good turnaround spot, especially if you&#x2019;ve started at the Visitor Center. <br><br>If you want to continue on, the trail climbs, mostly in conifers, to the ditch rider&#x2019;s road along the Tieton Irrigation Canal and on to FR 512, 6 and a half miles from the Visitor Center.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Be aware that Naches can be quite hot, so bring lots of sunscreen, water, and take it easy -- hiking in direct sunlight can be quite fatiguing.</p>\n                 ",

The trail provides a wonderful experience in a winter forest, the chance to visit a frozen alpine lake, and subalpine meadows in which to play and soak up the scenery.<br><br>From the upper end of the parking area, go right along a plowed driveway, passing a warming hut and restrooms, as well as a long maintenance shed, to find the trail. If the snow is stable and not too deep, climb the steep, open slope directly ahead to reach the main trail. If conditions are icy, or the climb looks too steep, follow the orange blazes to the left through the trees as the trail parallels the bottom of the hill. Soon you&apos;ll begin angling uphill and will quickly top out on a wide, level trail--it is actually the Paradise-Stevens Canyon Road. <br><br>Turn right, and snowshoe along this road as it loops out around the flank of Inspiration Point. The road quickly bears to the left and enters a long corridor in the forest. The way has little elevation gain, but it can&apos;t be called level because the snow rolls through tree wells and snowdrifts.<br><br>This trail through the trees brings you right to the edge of Reflection Lakes at 1.5 miles--although don&apos;t count on seeing your reflection because the lakes stay frozen over until June. That doesn&apos;t mean, however, that the ice is safe. This is an active volcano, and all that geothermal power keeps warm springs bubbling around and in most of the lakes in the area. That, in turn, keeps the ice on the lake surface thin and dangerous. But do take some time and expend a little energy exploring this lake basin and enjoying the stunning views of Mount Rainier, as well as the jagged line of peaks in the Tatoosh Range to the south.<br><br>From Reflection Lakes, push on east along the road as it curves through a big southern bend and then drops nearly 300 feet in 1 mile to loop down to the shore of Louise Lake. If the snow is stable, drop off the road just as it enters that big bend and angle down the slope directly to the lakeshore.<br><br>A camp on the eastern edge of the lake offers great views of a climbing route up Mount Rainier--someone always seems to be making an attempt at the summit. You&apos;ll also find that a camp on the east slope above the lake gives you a fantastic surprise in the morning--a stunning sunrise as the towering peak of Mount Rainier starts to glow first and then the sunlight moves slowly downslope until the entire 14,411-foot peak is brightly lit.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope.\n                 ",

That&apos;s exactly what&apos;s found at the end of this scenic, if somewhat strenuous, trek up the flank of the Tatoosh Range to a wide saddle between Pinnacle Peak and The Castle.<br><br>Proceed up the trail to Reflection Lakes (Route 84) at 1.5 miles, and from the southern shore of the larger lake, start a slow, steady climb up the steep meadows to the south. The route heads up a wide, open bowl near the lake&apos;s eastern end, providing the most gradual ascent and the least danger of avalanche. Near the top of the snowy meadow, the trail bears right near the tree line and traverses out around a small ridge crest. The snowshoe route lies roughly along the path of the Pinnacle Peak Trail from this point on.<br><br>At the end of the small ridge, bear left with the trail and climb along the crest of the ridge as it angles due south toward Pinnacle Peak. The ridge is thinning forest, so the snowshoeing is easy. Pick the path of least resistance through the pretty snow-laden trees, and keep climbing the moderately sloped ridge crest. Just 1 mile past Reflection Lakes, the route steepens significantly. To avoid the steep climb, angle left into an open snowfield. Although still pitched at an angle, this bowl is less steep than the route straight up Pinnacle Peak. Follow the open snowfield up to a high saddle with Pinnacle Peak on the right and The Castle to the left. NOTE: This last section is steep and frequently icy, requiring advanced skill to negotiate up it.<br><br>Though the summits of the two peaks seem to beckon, bear in mind that well-honed winter climbing skills, and the necessary hardware, are required to make either summit (and the narrow summits are typically crowned with dangerous cornices). The views from this saddle are comparable to what&apos;s found at the top of either peak anyway.<br><br>Speaking of views, as soon as you reach the saddle, turn around and soak in the awesome sight of Mount Rainier looming to the north. The saddle looks out across the valley to easily seen Paradise and, higher on the mountain, Camp Muir. Walk to the southern edge of the saddle, and look out across the Gifford Pinchot National Forest to Mount Adams, the Goat Rocks, Mount St. Helens, Mount Hood, and on really clear days, Mount Jefferson on the far southern horizon.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Most Difficult<br>Hikers should have good experience and familiarity with snowshoes. This route features sections that will need to be evaluated for avalanche safety every time. Trails climb considerably and may include climbing to ridge tops. Traverses across forested or open slopes may be required. An ability to self-arrest with an ice axe or trekking pole recommended.\n                 ",

There are also occasional glimpses of the snowy face of Mount Rainier, but the real beauty of this route is the wonderful local scenery. The deep old-growth forest is home to an assortment of birds and animals, including ravens, red foxes, and snowshoe hares. Because it is on the lower flanks of the mountain, this trail gets its snow later than the routes near Paradise. But once the big winter storms of January and February hit, Rampart Ridge is an excellent option, especially on those days when the Road to Paradise stays gated at Longmire well into late morning. The route is a loop trip that is best when hiked clockwise from Longmire Lodge, as there are gentler slopes to climb this way.<br><br>The snowshoe hike begins on the well-marked Trail of the Shadows nature walk. Go left on this small loop trail, and in just a few hundred yards, bear left again, leaving the meadow and starting up a wide, well-signed trail (Rampart Ridge Trail) into the trees. Even under deep snow, the trail is easy to follow through the woods. Continue upward, weaving between the mammoth old trees as the trail goes from one wide switchback to another.<br><br>In 2 miles, you&apos;ll reach the crest of the ridge and open views to the west of Nisqually Valley and the cone-shaped Tumtum Peak. A short bit beyond, you&apos;ll pass the high point of the route, and look down over the cliffs that give the ridge its name--The Ramparts. From here it&apos;s a relatively flat mile of forest hiking, with occasional meadows and views of Rainier, before reaching a trail junction with the Wonderland Trail. <br><br>If you want a bit more adventure, and a few more clear looks at the mountain, go straight to continue along the upper reaches of Rampart Ridge. The trail leads another 2.5 miles to Van Trump Park, gaining another 1500 feet along the way. This extension would increase your round-trip mileage to nearly 10 miles.<br><br>To close the loop, go right at the junction with the Wonderland Trail and descend through a long series of switchbacks, slicing through thick forest along the way. The final 0.5 mile of the trail is pretty much a gentle straight shot back to the road, just above Longmire. Hike the last 100 yards west along the shoulder of the Road to Paradise to reach the Longmire Lodge area.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: More Difficult<br>Some previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.).

Renowned for being able to &quot;live in two worlds&quot; So-To-Lick was dubbed Indian Henry by a mail carrier unable (or unwilling) to learn his real name. He guided the likes of John Muir, George Bayley, James Longmire and Philemon van Trump up sections of the massive mountain, but never summited it himself. Like many Native Americans, he considered the mountain sacred, never venturing onto the glaciers as it may bring bad luck.<br><br>The renowned guide has been memorialized for both his &quot;Boston&quot; name (Indian Henry) as well as his Native name. After So-To-Lick&apos;s death, van Trump named one of the many peaks that surround the hunting grounds after him: &quot;Satulick Mountain&quot;. <br><br>The tranquil meadows are accessible two ways, the Kautz Creek Trailhead near Longmire, and via the West Side Road. <br><br>Overall, the trail that starts at the White River Road is kinder to your knees than the Kautz Creek access, though there are a couple of washouts that must be skirted by steep trail reroutes, and&#x2014;with a two-mile road walk before the actual trailhead&#x2014;this way is considerably longer.<br><br>If you decide to explore Indian Henry&#x2019;s Hunting Ground this way, park at the closure of the West Side Road and hike or bike up the road two miles. Wind your way through large boulders, which come down in spring avalanches, and cross two small creeks (one has a bridge, one does not). Carry on via a straightaway that parallels the river until the road bends around to the left, ascending into a green tunnel of trees. This crook is your departure point. Turn right off the road, onto a trail that is largely marked by cairns for the first section. <br><br>It&#x2019;s a short forest walk before popping into the riverbed, where you&#x2019;ll follow a well-marked trail along the edge of the roaring torrent of Tahoma Creek. In spring, this can be quite high; check conditions before heading out. After a half-mile of riverside walking and cairn following, the trail turns left back into the forest. Ascending along the hillside, the trail soon arrives at the first washout. Marvel at the river&#x2019;s power that took such a large chunk out of the trail, then begin the steep climb up and over. Once past this washout, the trail resumes a moderate uphill grade to the second washout, steeper than the first. Clamber up and over exposed roots and descend sharply back down. Be careful here.<br><br>After conquering the two washouts, continue on, hiking along a gentle grade at first and then through some switchbacks leading up a ridge. At the top&#x2014;1.5 miles in&#x2014;is a sign indicating that you&#x2019;ve joined the Wonderland Trail. Take the right-hand fork, heading east on the Wonderland before arriving at a suspension bridge spanning Tahoma Creek. Cross the bridge and chug on uphill on the other side. <br><br>The trail maintains a steady grade for about two miles, leading you up hillsides, through green forest stocked with second-growth hemlocks and cedars, and stunning views of Rainier and the Tahoma Creek drainage and the glaciers that feed it. <br><br>One final push up and over a ridge puts you in sloping meadows carpeted with huckleberries and laced by little creeks: a precursor to your final destination. Continue on, arriving at a trail junction in Indian Henry&#x2019;s Hunting Ground, two and a half miles from where you joined the Wonderland Trail. <br><br>From this junction there are plenty of options for exploration. Take the trail branching to the left to visit Mirror Lake, or continue straight on and arrive at the ranger&#x2019;s cabin in about a quarter mile. From the cabin, rest up and imagine So-To-Lick living up here, hosting explorers and guiding them up the enormous mountain looming overhead. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Make the trip a thru-hike by continuing on the Wonderland and following the Kautz Creek trail out. Of course, you&#x2019;ll need to arrange a shuttle in order to do this route, but with the stunning wildflowers and views of Rainier, Adams, St. Helens, and the forests between spread out before you, it&#x2019;s hard to turn around.</p>\n                 ",

Campers overran Shoe Lake in the 1980s, and the fragile meadows around <br>the pond were crisscrossed with social trails and dotted with bare-earth tent sites. In the years since camping has been prohibited, the vegetation has slowly recovered, though faint trails still show through the wildflowers. This trail which runs along Hogback Mountain is a classic example of what most folks think of when they hear Pacific &quot;Crest&quot; Trail-a faint footpath through alpine meadows hugging the side of a knife-edged ridge.<br><br>The Pacific Crest Trail angles southeast for the first 2.5 miles, skirting the edge of the White Pass Ski Area. This initial section climbs modestly through open pine forests, gaining 1000 feet in those 2.5 miles, to a junction with the Three Peaks Trail. There, our route bears west and the forests open even more, as the trail weaves between sun-dappled woods and sun-filled meadows. <br><br>At 3.5 miles, a short spur trail leads north to the top of the ski lifts. The PCT, though, continues southwest along the east flank of Hogback Mountain.<br><br>This remnant of the once-great Goat Rocks Volcano is a jagged peak with long, knife-sharp ridges leading north and south from the summit. The trail hugs the southern ridge, contouring along the 6400-foot level. A few wildflowers struggle for survival on this steep slope, but mostly the trail slides across scree slopes and pika-playgrounds on the curving ridge wall. <br><br>At just over 6 miles from the trail, the PCT crosses a narrow shoulder of the mountain at 6600 feet. Pause here to soak up the incredible views before you-the horseshoe-shaped Shoe Lake lies 400 feet below, while far beyond the lake to the southeast is the cliff-lined Pinegrass Ridge. <br><br>From the ridge top, it&apos;s another 0.5 mile down to the lakeshore, and then there&apos;s a 0.5-mile trail around the lake to explore. Wildflower meadows surround the lake, with a small grove of shade-providing evergreens on the peninsula in the center of the lake&apos;s horseshoe. Those who insist on camping nearby should return to the PCT and continue south about a mile to Hidden Spring Camp.</p>\n                 ",

This trail dips into thick old stands of forest, but it is the open meadows, long ridges, and high peaks that make this a special trail. Pass by large circular plains of snow (frozen lakes) and rolling dunes of drifted snow. This trail offers an immersion into the dreamlands of mountain country in winter.

At the lake, the trail turns north once more and rolls gently uphill through meadows broken occasionally by thin stands of wind-gnarled trees. The trail is obliterated by snow in this open country, but the route stays along the broad crest of a shallow ridge as it leads due north.<br><br>At 3.3 miles, find Sand Lake on the right (east) side of the ridge. The lake is often obscured because the gentle slope of the banks and the surrounding open country allow the snow to drift in and cover it. So look for an oblong flat surface just below the ridgeline at 5300 feet. This is the place to turn around, unless you plan on pitching camp out in the winter wilderness. For extended exploring, hike on up the trail as it rolls north, pushing through more meadows, forests, and past small alpine lakes. <br><br>The Sand Lake basin and the small ridge above it offer nice views of the surrounding peaks, including Cramer Mountain to the north, Spiral Butte to the east, and Round Mountain to the southeast.

Over the entire trail length, the elevation gain is less than 300 feet. Walking ease doesn&apos;t correspond to a lack of interesting sights, though. The best and most dominant feature of this hike is the ever-beautiful Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and the smaller Little Lava Creek on the other side of the valley. We enjoy simply listening to the river; watching the cold, clear water roll over the rocks; admiring the thirsty wildlife that gathers on its shores; or casting a fly into the river and feeling the raw energy of the strong, toothy trout that prowl the icy pools and eddies. In addition to the river, the trail leads to Lily Lake, a small mea-dow tarn that is the favorite haunt of muskrats and mule deer. <br><br>&quot;The trail leaves the road-end trailhead and ambles gently east, darting into and out of the forests that line the valley floor. To the north, Highway 12 rides along the valley wall, so you might hear a bit of road noise, but generally the music of the tumbling river drowns out the less pleasant sounds.Walk quietly along this path, and keep kids and dogs close at hand, and you might be surprised at the wildlife you&apos;ll find. Despite the proximity to the road, the valley bottom harbors a host of critters. Mule deer and even Rocky Mountain elk thrive here, as well as smaller beasts such as beavers, muskrats, and weasels. Because of the abundance of water, you&apos;ll also find a host of birds, both tiny tweeters such as juncos and big, soaring raptors such as redtail hawks and turkey vultures.Lily Lake, at 1.5 miles, makes a fine picnic spot and turnaround point-though, if you want to go farther, the trail stretches on for many more miles, linking up with Clear Lost and other trails leading deep into the Goat Rocks Wilderness.</p>\n                 ",

You&apos;ll find some broken views to the south, and nice looks north to the craggy summit of Shellrock, but push on for better scenery and more open vistas.The trail descends gradually from this point on, rolling down the ridgeline through pretty forests to the south face of Ironstone Mountain. Here, at about 6 miles out, you&apos;ll break out into the broad expanse of Fox Meadow below the summit of Ironstone Mountain.

The trail is adequately wide the rest of the way. Huckleberries are plentiful along the lower part. Bear grass, trilliums, and penstemon are less common.<br><br>The ascent is moderately steep and has few switchbacks, climbing steadily to the north-northwest just below or along the crest of Sawtooth Ridge. The tread is good, with few roots or rocks to contend with. At 0.7 and 0.9 miles are wooden benches, offering a convenient place to rest. From here on, the trail steepens, as trailside vegetation thins in favor of larger trees.<br><br>At 1.3 miles, the trail tops the ridgeline at a rock outcropping and viewpoint. A steep drop-off prevents getting an easy view of the summit, but it is close. Continue up the west side of the ridge top, passing below the visible lookout cabin, to the northern edge of Sawtooth Ridge, where the sheerness of the northern face becomes apparent. Turn right for the final 200 yards, onto the large and flat sloped rock that the lookout building is fastened to. The cabin was built in 1929, but is no longer staffed.

The exposure on this pillar is worthy of caution; there are no longer any cables to protect you from a sheer vertical drop, as much as 600 feet on the north side. Enjoy the views from the rock or from the wraparound deck of the lookout cabin. Mount Rainier is to the northeast, as is Cora Lake, over 1800 feet below you.

The trail descends to the banks of the Palouse River where you can check out the smaller but no less beautiful Upper Palouse Falls or Squaw Falls. The trail then wanders through the basalt canyon to the head of the majestic Palouse Falls.<br><br>At the end of the last ice age, repeated glacial floods, known as the Missoula Floods, swept across eastern Washington carving out the unique scablands landscape we see today. Amongst the coulees, potholes, buttes, and plateaus, Palouse Falls remains as one of the magnificent and lasting remnants of these glacial floods. It is the only major waterfall left along this thousands of years old glacial flood path, and as of February 12, 2014, is Washington&apos;s official state waterfall. Standing at a height of 198 feet and surrounded by striking basalt cliffs, the powerful waterfall lies on the Palouse River upstream of the confluence with the Snake River. <br><br>Formerly known as Aput Aput, meaning &#x201C;Falling Water,&#x201D; so named by the Palouse Indians, Palouse Falls is located within Palouse Falls State Park. The park boasts a 105-acre camping area with 11 tent spaces, including one campsite that is ADA compliant. All sites are available on a first come, first served basis. You will also find other amenities including sheltered and unsheltered picnic tables, information kiosks, pit toilet restrooms, and wheelchair accessible paths. All visitors should be aware that this area is home to rattlesnakes, so be careful where you walk. You may also encounter the infamous yellow-bellied marmot during your visit. Many reside in the park and can be found grazing throughout the area. <br><br>From the trailhead, continue for 1/3 of a mile until the gravel path comes to an end. Keep an eye out for wildflowers that add splashes of color to the landscape. You will see a dirt path ahead that descends into the canyon, hugging the chain link fence next to the railroad tracks. Once you reach the fence, there appears to be a trail immediately to the right that leads to the base of the canyon; however, avoid using this trail. It is quite steep and riddled with loose rocks making for a potentially hazardous descent. Instead, opt for the more gradual descent by following the fence along the train tracks a few dozen yards where you will find a much more manageable path. <br><br>You will quickly enter the canyon flanked on either side by marvelous basalt rock formations and tall sage brush. Unfortunately, over time, some of the rocks have been vandalized with graffiti. Try to ignore this and instead take in the sight of the lovely Squaw Falls directly ahead of you. Make sure to stop here and enjoy these less frequented falls before continuing on. <br><br>The trail meanders through the canyon for about another half-mile to a magnificent rock formation known as Castle Rock that crowns the head of Palouse Falls. At this point the Falls can be heard but unfortunately not quite seen from a safe vantage point. You may notice a few narrow trails that appear to lead down to the Falls; however, be aware that there is no safe way to reach those trails or the bottom of the Falls from this point. Instead take in the views of the canyon and the sounds of falling water before making your way back to the parking lot.<br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: Time your visit to the falls with the sunset. Watching the light and shadows change along the canyon walls is an experience not to be missed. This time of day also offers the opportunity to take advantage of the optimal golden hour lighting that so many photographers seek.</p>\n                 ",

From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail. This trail climbs 1 mile south along the benchlands above the ravine to a junction with the Bench Loop Trail and a connection with the west leg of the Cowiche Mountain Loop Trail. Continue heading upward, south, then east, on a fairly direct line with the 2,970 summit and a junction with the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail and Rocky Top Trails. <br><br>Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover.

These big majestic beasts thrive along the eastern flank of the South Cascades, and come winter, hundreds of elk winter in the meadows of Tieton River Valley. As the snow deepens, the elk move farther down the valley, feasting on the rich grasses that fill the meadows. Throughout the summer the elk disperse, though a few always seem to linger here, and come autumn the herds are back as the big bulls try the capture the attention of the cows during the rut. This is a magical time to visit the meadows as the lust-crazed bulls bugle challenges at each other. These melodious calls ring through the forests and meadows of the Tieton Valley through much of September. Of course, the meadows mean more than mere elk. Birds and beasts of all sizes, colors and species fill these rich fields. Exploring the meadows is an exercise in wildlife watching.<br><br>Shortly after you leave the trailhead, the path splits.

And where there are birds, there are hunters. Weasels, martens, bobcats, red foxes, and coyotes prowl these areas.<br><br>At about 1.5 miles, the primary trail turns sharply to the south and then east, climbing steeply away from the valley floor. Ignore that climb. Instead, veer to the right onto a primitive path away from the established trail and angle back down onto the floor, up-valley from the marshlands. In less than 0.25 mile, you&apos;ll be in extensive grass meadows. In spring and early summer, the meadows are awash in color as wildflower blooms fill the valley.

These elk pastures are broken up by beautiful stands of ponderosa pine and spruce forests, and are home to not only elk but also white-tailed and mule deer and a host of small critters. <br><br>Indeed, so great is the number of meadows that many hikers find it more enjoyable to leave the trail altogether and journey up to the lake by going cross-country through the forest glades. This is a great place to practice your off-trail rambling, but before leaving the trail, be sure you have map and compass and the skill to use them effectively. <br><br>The first 3.5 miles of trail thread through these patchwork wildflower meadows, but the upper end of the route is enclosed in denser forests until, near the lake, the route breaks out into alpine clearings. Above the pretty little lake loom some of the great craggy peaks that give the Goat Rocks Wilderness its name. With a pair of binoculars and a little patience, it&apos;s possible to spot the creatures themselves. Mountain goats scramble among the rocky slopes high above the lake, jumping lightly about the cliffs that lie between the forest and the glaciers. Look for them on the bare rocks above green fields of moss and grass.<br><br>There are good campsites at the lake and along the numerous meadows farther down the trail. If you choose to camp in a meadow, though, wander as far off trail as is reasonable and look for a campsite that is sheltered from the trail by a stand of trees. This will shield your camp from other hikers so they can continue to enjoy their sense of solitude in this wild, beautiful area.</p>\n                 ",

The trail is far too narrow and the forest is way too close for most skiers&apos; comfort.<br><br>All but the first 0.5 mile of trail is within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, so the forest is ancient, undisturbed old growth.

    "desc": "\n                    This lake is a popular summer destination for family campers, and it is even more impressive when visited in winter. The large lake is just outside the border of the Goat Rocks Wilderness Area, and an old service road slices through the forest alongside a water pipeline all the way to the dam at the lower end of the lake. The hike from the road end to the lake weaves through thick, old forest, and views are limited. But the local scenery makes up for the lack of distant sights.<br><br>This road provides easy early-winter access to skiers and snowmobilers. After a few snowstorms, the road is made impassable by avalanches, and snowshoers will find the trail through the young forest silent and seemingly made with them in mind. The trail, though, is in avalanche country too, so snowshoers must know the current avalanche conditions and should avoid this trail when the danger is any higher than moderate.<br><br>Whether you walk or drive to the official trailhead, you&apos;ll want to spend a few minutes there. The view is remarkable because a big, open window in the trees perfectly frames that big snow cone to the north, Mount Rainier.<br><br>Upon leaving the trailhead, the trail is fairly wide and easy to follow. It dips immediately into the sparse old forest and enters a shadowy world of green, gray, and white. The trail meanders up and down, gradually gaining elevation over the first 4 miles only to drop more than 200 feet in the last 0.5 mile before rolling out along the lakeshore. In periods of unusually heavy snow, the 4 miles of trail may be stretched by an additional 2 or 3 miles of road walking. But that extra mileage just makes for a more rewarding payoff at camp at day&apos;s end.<br><br>The snow underfoot is bright against the dull gray fir and cedar tree trunks, while overhead, waxy green boughs and droopy beards of green lichen provide color to this cold sylvan world. But the best of the scenery is not the stationary stuff around you; it&apos;s the small gray streaks that flit from tree to tree. These feathery bundles of energy go by many names--whiskey jacks, gray jays, or camp-robbers--but regardless of what you call them, you will enjoy their company. <br><br>The south shore of the lake is the safest haven for camp because it is gently graded and well forested, which minimizes the threat of snowslides. It also offers the best views. Plenty of sheltered areas for camps are scattered along the length of the lake, but smart campers will pitch their tents at the far end of the lake so they can enjoy the fiery sunsets that illuminate Mount Rainier to the north. If weather clouds the horizon, though, the views to the south are nearly as stunning--the 7487-foot Johnson Peak looms large at the head of the Packwood Creek valley. <br><br>A word of warning: amidst all this beauty, danger lurks close by. The snowy mantle covering the lake looks stable and strong, but this is a big body of water at the relatively low elevation of 2900 feet, so the ice is almost always too thin to bear the weight of heavy bodies tramping across it. Stay off the lake. If you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll likely end up in the lake, and in winter that means hypothermia.<br><br>Author&#x2019;s Rating: Most Difficult<br>Hikers should have good experience and familiarity with snowshoes. This route features sections that will need to be evaluated for avalanche safety every time. Trails climb considerably and may include climbing to ridge tops. Traverses across forested or open slopes may be required. An ability to self-arrest with an ice axe or trekking pole recommended.\n                 ",

Follow this reconstructed trail for nearly 0.5 mile through dense forest before erupting out of the trees onto the upper section of the road.

But spectacular views await the patient and persistent. The 2800-foot elevation gain brings hikers to a vantage point that is unrivaled in the area. Once a Forest Service lookout tower stood here, but now all that is left are great views of the Cowlitz River Valley to the north and west; the high, craggy Smith Ridge to the east; and Goat Dike, a precipitous cliff, directly below on the north side of the ridge. On clear days the top of Mount Rainier can also be seen peeking up over the ridges to the north. <br><br>The trail begins by following the old roadbed a short distance before angling upward into the dense Douglas-fir forest. This young forest is dark and cool, which could be seen as a blessing, or a curse. It&apos;s a blessing because the trail climbs relentlessly from the start, weaving upward through endless switchbacks until sweat is running off you in rivers. If the forest were more open and sun-dappled, you&apos;d surely bake on this steep ascent. The curse comes because even as the close canopy cools you, it also prevents any views outward. <br><br>For a full 3.4 miles, you&apos;ll hike under forest canopy. It&apos;s a pretty forest, full of birds and small critters. Finally, though, when you most ache for an open view, the trail crests the top of Smith Point and before you stretch the endless views you&apos;d expect at a former lookout site, with Mount Rainier, Cowlitz Valley, the Goat Rocks, and all the peaks in the heart of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest spread out before you.\n                 ",

Hiking to Snowgrass Flats, then heading east to Cispus Basin and completing a loop on the Nannie Ridge Trail. Along the way, experience a broad expanse of meadow blooms with a lovely waterfall and the Goat Rocks looming overhead and Mount Adams close enough to touch to the south. <br><br>We offer a clockwise loop here, but it is just as beautiful the other way too. From Snowgrass trailhead at about 4700 feet, hike the first two miles through forest, mostly gradual uphill, to a bridge over Goat Creek, then a bit steeper to the intersection with bypass trail 97 and Snowgrass Flats at four miles.<br><br>Go left to find a spot at the Alpine Camp near the Snowgrass meadows. But more exalted terrain awaits you if you take a right at the junction on the Bypass Trail (97) and hook up with the PCT. Drop your pack here and explore about for awhile before you continue east to the lovely expanse of Cispus Basin. This area boasts two incredible view camps with a fraction of the people you would find at Snowgrass. <br><br>The trail circles left and down into the basin with Gilbert Peak and the Goat Rocks massif just ahead. Mount Adams feels close enough to touch to the south. Lupine, paintbrush, alpine daisies and lots of low-bush blueberries abound. Pass a 20-foot waterfall (scramble up the rocks to camps just above) and another creek crossing, where more camps are hidden in the trees just above before starting up the rocky switchbacks to Cispus Pass. The trail climbs just 300 feet more to the pass, steadily opening up views of the forested ridges of the Nannie Creek and Walupt Lake basins.  <br><br>Cispus Pass is a small saddle at 6400 feet, with views east to the headwaters of the Klickitat River. The PCT continues to beckon southward, clinging to the side of the hill for another half-mile until passing back over to the west side of the ridge and dropping steeply to the intersection of the PCT with the Nannie Ridge trail 98 at 1.9 miles from the pass. Pretty little alpine Sheep Lake at 5800 feet is just past the junction, with a few more nice camps nearby, accessible from either trail. Follow Nannie Ridge with just a few ups and downs for about 2.5 miles to a junction and a nice little scramble route to the top of Nannie Peak, or another two miles with a final steep downhill to the Walupt Lake trailhead at 4000 feet, 6.4 miles from Cispus Pass.<br><br>The best way to finish this hike is by placing a second car at Walupt Lake. It is, however, possible to hike back up to the Snowgrass Flat trailhead at Chambers Lake. The approximate distance from Walupt to Chambers is six miles, and it is on a fairly rough trail that requires a fording and some trail-finding skills.<br><br>Follow the trail along the road (or just walk on the road) exiting the campground just past the horse camp, about 1.6 miles from the lake. Then go right (north) on Trail 7A as it returns to your car at Chambers Lake. One mile into trail 7A back to Chambers Lake you will come to a river that requires a slippery, boots off, knee-high fording. When you first approach the river, continue on the trail until it dead ends at the river shore - don&apos;t take the first river access trail. <br><br>Across the river on a tree is a very tiny sign that says 7A. Look for the orange marking tape in in the tree branches. That&apos;s where the trail picks up again. 7A signs are infrequent and hard to spot but will keep you on route until you emerge from the trail onto a forest road with firepit remains. Take the road left for about an eighth of a mile until you see the 7A sign as the trail picks up again on the left side of the road. Take 7A until you come to another road; the trail continues straight across but is not marked. <br><br>Following this unmarked trail, you will come to a third road. Take a right down the road and the take your first left on the first intersection you encounter (50 ft). Continue on this road for some time as it becomes quite overgrown in places, and will eventually connect with the wide gravel road you drove in on. Go right (uphill) to get back to the Snowgrass trailhead. <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: There are segments of trail 7A that parallel the road - try to find and use them as they are a shorter distance than walking the road.</p>\n                 ",

But it&apos;s not just the big snow-capped cones that are seen. Lesser volcanoes-perfectly formed cinder cones-can be seen scattered throughout the southern Cascades, in addition to the ancient volcanic peaks of the Goat Rocks.

Also look for rock formations that look like ancient medieval fortifications, well guarded by marmots.  The way gets more and more rocky, with some snow patches to cross (no ice axes required) until finally you break into views of Mt Rainier to the northwest and Goat Lake just west.

A bit of hand-climbing required but nothing highly technical - just watch for rocks kicked loose by the people climbing just above.  At the top there is room to sit for a snack and take pictures of the amazing panorama encompassing the McCall, Conrad and Meade Glaciers around Ives and Gilbert Peaks, down along the spine of the Goat Rocks toward Mt Adams, southwest to St Helens, west to Goat Lake and Packwood Lake, north along the bare rocky ridges, and northeast through the forested valleys past McCall Basin and on to White Pass.<br><br>Back down Snowy to the PCT junction, head due north.  The trail is scraped into the precipice but still fairly secure;  just don&apos;t take any chances with passing horsepackers or bad weather.   Some times of year may have to cross a steep snowfield so be sure to wait for a bit of melting in the AM to get a secure purchase.

The route is long, sun-baked, and incredibly scenic, while the trail itself is rough, steep and very exposed. One section on the flank of Whittier was blasted from a sheer rock face-anyone with acrophobia should be prepared for a case of the jitters, as the trail on this section features a sheer drop. Indeed, given the rough-hewn nature of much of the Mount Whittier section of the route, we join the national monument officials in recommending that only experienced hikers comfortable on scramble routes attempt this trail.

The way then turns northward, following the ridgeline to reach Norway Pass (4500 feet) at 2.2 miles. From the pass, enjoy great views down the ash-laden valley to Spirit Lake; note the huge cluster of logs that cover the lake surface, the remains of the once great forest that surrounded the beautiful lake. <br><br>Continue north 1 mile from Norway to Bear Pass (5000 feet) and the start of the loop section.

In the next 5 miles, you&apos;ll pass several small lakes, set in the blast-scoured landscape like fine gems in a tarnished ring. You&apos;ll skirt the eastern edge of Grizzly Lake, travel between Twin Lakes and Boot Lake, and swing around the southern shore of Panhandle Lake to reach the north side of Shovel Lake. <br><br>At 8 miles, the trail splits. Stay left to climb the Mount Whittier Trail southeast, and in just a mile you&apos;ll be on the summit ridge, oohing and ahhing over the scenery laid before you. To the south resides the still-steaming mass of Mount St. Helens--you can peer directly into the breach of the northeastern face of the once-great mountain to see the building lava dome in the crater.

Huckleberries, wild strawberries, and an assortment of mushrooms thrive in the area around the lakes, and wildlife-from white-tailed deer and black bear to deer mice and blackbirds-linger close by to feed on the boun-tiful harvest.

The scramble to the top is worth the effort, as it brings wonderful views of Mount Adams and the volcanic landscape of the country north of the mountain. One of the most impressive sights is the sprawling Muddy Fork Lava Bed that seems to flow from the perfect cone of Red Butte (7200 feet) on Adams&apos;s northeast slope.<br>Potato Hill is centered on a north-south fault line that also runs under Mount Adams, and around 110,000 years ago, the mountain was formed when an eruption of basalt lava spewed out of the fissure along this fault line. The cinder cone that was left behind became Potato Hill.<br><br><br>The Pacific Crest Trail heads north from the trailhead with the perfect cone of Potato Hill in sight all the way. The trail is relatively level and well maintained, and the vegetation is mostly low trees and brush.

If the 500-foot gain tires you, pull up for a breather and enjoy the wonderful views to the south and west.

One of Washington&apos;s finest protected wilderness areas, though, fails to meet any of those expectations.<br><br>Deep in the heart of the dry, desert country of the lower Columbia Basin sits the Juniper Dunes Wilderness Area, the only Bureau of Land Management wilderness in the entire state. Covering just 7,140 acres, it is also the only wilderness area in the state to be completely enclosed by barbed wire--put there not to keep the animals in but to keep the motorcycles and ORVs out. Fortunately, the wire works and the deer and coyotes can leap over or under the wire as they please. <br><br>The Juniper Dunes Wilderness exists as an oasis of natural wonder just a few minutes drive from the urban sprawl of Pasco. The only trail in this wilderness is an old jeep track that slices across the southern end of the small desert preserve, but no trails are needed here. To experience the wonders of this place, simply disappear into the sand dunes and juniper groves.<br><br>You&apos;ll find six large groves of the desert juniper trees, the largest remaining concentration of this species this far north. Between the well-spaced groves are individual trees--some of which truly could be classified as old-growth specimens. Many of the broad, fragrant trees are hundreds of years old, but this is no old growth forest. Aside from the few large groves, most of the trees exist in small clumps of no more than two or three trees scattered across the rolling hills.<br><br>A wonderful array of plant life populates these low hills, which are indeed sand dunes--but not in the &quot;Sahara Desert&quot; sense of the term. A few barren mounds of shifting sand are present, but most dunes are carpeted with sagebrush, wild rye grass, Indian ricegrass, an assortment of such desert flowers as phlox, larkspur, and blue-eyed Marys, and a few small species of cactus including prickly pear and Simpson&apos;s hedgehog.<br><br>A complex web of animal tracks criss-crosses the sands. As you explore the wilderness area, watch for mule deer, coyotes, foxes, rattlesnakes, deer mice, kangaroo rats, porcupines, badgers, rabbits, and skunks, among others. Red-tailed hawks, turkey vultures, prairie falcons, and golden eagles circle overhead, and great horned owls stare from the thick branches of the junipers. I can&apos;t even begin to identify the assortment of small birds that flitter around the sagebrush and juniper branches.<br><br>This small wilderness is a wildlife-lover&apos;s dream. The lack of trails means you can roam freely throughout the area, following bird songs and animal tracks. If you get lost, a hike of not more than 4.5 miles in any direction will take you to the boundary of the wilderness area, marked with a strong, steel, barbed wire fence (to keep out the motorcycle and four-wheel-drive enthusiasts who recreate on the surrounding BLM property).<br><br>Spring is the ideal time to visit as the desert bursts with new growth and increased animal activity. The junipers acquire fresh shoots of new, green needles, the desert flowers are all blooming, the mammals are scurrying around looking for mates and new homes and some fresh food, and the reptiles are still largely inactive due to the still-cold nights.<br><br>Hikers can pitch camp anywhere they please in the wilderness, but the lack of any water source means folks will have to pack in all the water they need for their stay. In the spring, that&apos;s not too hard, but by July, when daytime temperatures can reach and exceed 100 degrees F., it means carrying several gallons of water on your back. If you go, take plenty of water, a good pair of binoculars, and a camera. You&apos;ll want to record this unique jewel of a wilderness area.</p>\n                 ",

Continue up the ridge for views down to Coldwater Lake and north to the Coldwater Ridge Visitor Center&#x2014;mothballed for several years, but now a learning and science center for education and conservancy groups. <br><br>You&apos;ll follow old roadbed for another mile. In late summer, ripe huckleberry bushes will slow your pace. Look left shortly before the junction with Lakes Trail 230&#x2014;you might miss an old bulldozer set askew from the volcanic blast. The junction is your turnaround point, but check in with your legs. If you&apos;re feeling adventuresom, press on. Another two miles down the trail to the left will take you down to a bridge over Coldwater Creek. Another steep mile down the righthand trail takes you to Ridge Camp, one of eight reservable camps in the Mount Margaret Backcountry and Coldwater Saddle, with stunning views of the ridges and valleys north of the mountain. <br><br>Back at the trailhead, take a few moments to stretch and dust yourself off&#x2014;you&#x2019;re likely covered in volcanic ash! If time allows, stop by the Coldwater Lake picnic area to clean up and walk the Birth of a Lake Nature Trail 246, a half-mile concrete path and boardwalk that is ADA-accessible. <br><br>A loop hike is possible by adding Lakes Trail 211 and fully circumnavigating Coldwater Lake. This is best done with a group and a car drop or key exchange, with cars at the South Coldwater trailhead and the Coldwater Lake boat launch. You could walk the shy mile from the boat launch to the South Coldwater trailhead, but it involves a dicey road walk along SR 504, with cars, motorcycles, tour buses and motorhomes blasting by you. Expect about 10 miles and 2,000 feet of cumulative gain. <br><br>WTA Pro Tips: If you&#x2019;re on this hike at the peak of summer heat, pocket some hard candy or mints to keep the saliva flowing between gulps of water. For supper, enjoy an elk burger and berry cobbler with views of the Toutle River at Patty&#x2019;s Place at 19-Mile House. If you can wait, tell your tummy to hold on for Papa Pete&#x2019;s Pizza in Castle Rock if your return trip is south, or McMenamins Olympic Club in old downtown Centralia if your return trip is north.</p>\n                 ",

Take in the mountain from this angle, which offers a direct line of sight across the plains and into the blast zone. Is the dome smoking today? Check again as you hike &#x2013; conditions in the crater change from hour to hour. <br><br>Follow a paved pathway that leads up several tight switchbacks to an overlook of the mountain. From here you can also see down the valley, where the silvery thread of the Toutle River winds away out of sight. A metal map here offers excellent insight into the surrounding peaks and other landmarks. It&#x2019;s worth taking some time with it to orient yourself and learn what you&#x2019;re looking at. <br><br>When you&#x2019;ve examined the landscape and learned a few of the peaks, proceed along the paved path, continuing downhill and to the west. The trail follows a ridgeline here and the mountain is nearly always visible, but occasionally disappears from view as you round a hummock.<br><br>A mile and a half from the parking lot, arrive at a junction. The trail to the right is what you want &#x2013; it leads you across the base of a steep, cliffy hill. This section may pose trouble to those with a fear of heights. Stick close to the inside of the trail, avoid the outer edge and the traverse should be just fine. Upon successfully crossing this section, a new expanse of prairie comes into view. Take a moment at this vantage point and look for Mount Adams on the northern horizon. <br><br>Continue through rolling, dusty hills and hummocks, occasionally losing sight of the mountain but never lacking for visual stimulation. The area is fascinating and full of life, though it looks barren at first glance. At three miles, leave this section and enter a surprisingly lush area. <br><br>Huckleberry bushes abound here at the transition between deserty blast zone and green, lush hillside. Shortly arrive at a junction at about 3.5 miles. The trail heading straight on is the Boundary Trail, one that heads into the Mount Margaret wilderness. Harry&#x2019;s Ridge is to your right, up a ridge that offers views of Spirit Lake and Mount Adams. <br><br>Take in the sapphire-blue lake below and the enormous log raft. These are downed trees from the 1980 eruption that have slowly been pushed by snow or other natural forces into the lake. Winds in this area push the raft around, so it may change shape during your visit. <br><br>Almost there. Continue up the ridge to an outcropping of cement and metal, remains of an old weather station and observatory. This is the high point of the hike, and though the trail itself continues downhill, make it your stopping point for lunch, where you can gaze at the white cap of Mount Adams and the smoking lava dome of St. Helens simutaneously. On the way back down, be sure to check the shape of the log raft in Spirit Lake before heading towards the Visitors Center.</p>\n                 ",

Ms. Hansen served twenty-two years in the state legislature and fourteen years in Congress. She was instrumental in establishing the 5600-acre refuge.<br><br>Center Road is a gated and grassy &quot;service road.&quot;It marches right through the middle of the refuge, offering plenty of opportunities for spotting a few of the three hundred shy deer residing here. Elk, coyotes, otters, herons, eagles, kingfishers, and osprey are all frequently sighted if you come up short in the deer department.<br><br>The trail is only open in the summer months, and your best bet for seeing deer is early in the morning or late in the day.

Either retrace your steps or return via the very lightly traveled Steamboat Slough Road for a loop, adding 0.5 mile. Views along the way include wide sweeping Columbia River vistas that enticed Captain William Clark (of Lewis and Clark fame) to exclaim, &quot;Ocian in view!&quot; He was a little premature, but not that far off.\n                 ",

The explosive superheated winds that came out of the eruption laid all the mighty trees down neatly and perfectly arranged, all side-by-side.

From the viewing area, the trail loops down to the canyon rim in a long series of steep (for wheelchair users) switchback turns offering excellent views. The Muddy River cuts through the heart of this basalt canyon, which was scoured clean by the rushing mudflows during the 1980 eruption. The main Lava Canyon Trail continues east along the wild gorge of the Muddy River. You won&apos;t find grand vistas or sweeping panoramas here. You will find a remarkable lesson in geological change-this valley was carved in part by a massive lahar, or volcano-induced mudflow of massive proportions.<br><br>Start off your hike with a warm-up along the 0.5-mile-long Lava Canyon Interpretive Trail.

The trail starts on a few metal stairs through the fields of broken lava, then leads across a springy suspension bridge.

A stand of trees atop the fin appear to be masts rising from a ship of rock. The spur trail leads to the crest of this formation, offering views of a series of small waterfalls in the lower Muddy River canyon. <br><br>The main trail continues down the canyon, weaving through dense forest growth along the steep canyon wall. The exposure here is extreme at times, as the path runs along the edge of the gorge now and then. Use extreme caution.

This hike is very challenging, with sparse camps, little water and some sketchy sections of loose pumice. Since the eruption denuded the slopes of the mountain, you&#x2019;re almost always in sun, so make sure you wear your hat and bring sunscreen. It is all too easy to get a severe sunburn on these slopes.<br><br>With those cautions in mind, you&#x2019;ll fully appreciate the stark, otherworldly beauty of the blast zone.

(If you want a taste of the Loowit without the full meal deal, each of these hikes is a great way to sample the mountain.)<br><br>Windy Ridge<br>Follow the Truman Trail (#207) for approx. 3 miles, then take the Windy Trail (#216E) for another 1 mile to the Loowit (#216). This route will take you closest to &#x201C;The Breach&#x201D; and Loowit Falls. Note that camping is not allowed in the blast zone which includes the northern portion of the mountain between the South Fork of the Toutle River and Windy Pass.<br><br>Ape Canyon Trailhead<br>Park at the Ape Canyon Trailhead and go 5.5 miles on the Ape Canyon Trail (#234) to the junction with the Loowit (#216). Turn right (north) and hike another mile or two across the spectacular Plains of Abraham. Note this route is very popular with mountain bikers.<br><br>Climber&#x2019;s Bivouac<br>Take the Ptarmigan Trail (#216A) 2 miles to the junction with the Loowit (#216). Turn left or right to experience the Loowit as it skirts the treeline along the volcano&#x2019;s southern flank.<br><br>Blue Lake Trailhead<br>Follow the Toutle Trail (#238) for about 3 miles. Ascend the Sheep Canyon Trail (#240) 2.5 miles to the Loowit. You can make a nice lollipop loop by following the Loowit another 2.5 miles north to its intersection with the terminus of the Toutle Trail, then following the Toutle Trail approx 5 miles back to the Blue Lake Trailhead. <br><br>Circumnavigating Mount St. Helens<br>Some recommend starting from the south at Climber&#x2019;s Bivouac while others chose to start on the NE side from Windy Ridge. In either case you need to plan on crossing the blast zone in one push as camping is prohibited between the South Fork of the Toutle River and Windy Pass.  Since the most rugged section is on the west side where major washouts require extensive detours and/or scrambles, plan your trip to hit those sections when you are relatively fresh.<br><br>Although each year hikers do complete the Loowit, others have turned back unable to find safe passage through some of the gullies. Since conditions change so frequently and people&#x2019;s route finding ability and tolerance for risk vary, it is impossible to predict if the circumnavigation is &#x201C;doable&#x201D; at any given time for any hiker.<br><br>This route description is for a counter-clockwise circumnavigation hike starting from the north side where the Windy Trail (#216E) meets the Loowit. <br><br>Your first seven miles will afford near constant views of denuded slopes as you cross the blast zone looking into &#x201C;The Breach&#x201D;.  A short side-trail to Loowit Falls is a worthwhile break.  As you come around the mountain to the NW, the route drops into the valley carved by the South Fork of the Toutle.  Here the trail is frequently obliterated by the river and sliding loose rock and pumice. Crossing this gully is the first of three major wash-outs on the route.<br><br>Continuing on the Loowit, the trail climbs up into remnant old growth forest on Crescent Ridge, and then enters a zone of burned trees and flower-rife meadows. You&#x2019;ll enter subalpine forest, the trail climbing and falling until it again ascends to timberline near 4,700 ft.  About a &#xBD; mile beyond the junction with the Sheep Canyon Trail the Loowit was obliterated by a washout in the Blue Lake Wash, leaving a huge chasm with near vertical walls in its place. The Forest Service completed a bypass route that adds another few miles, but it is much safer than attempting to scramble through the massive gully.<br><br>Next, you&#x2019;ll reach the junction with the Butte Camp Trail #238A. You can drop steeply along this trail&#x2014;roughly 800 feet&#x2014;to Butte Camp, if you need to make camp.<br><br>Most of the trail from here on in is rugged as it runs through several lava beds, sometimes with nothing but posts or cairns to show the way.  After crossing Swift Creek (the winter climbing route), there is one more lava bed crossing to the junction with the June Lake Trail. For a pleasant campsite, follow the steep June Lake Trail (#216B) &#xBC; mile to its namesake lake. Continuing around the SE side of the Mountain you will encounter the 3rd major washout on the Loowit at Muddy Creek. It is approx. 4 miles from the June Lake Trail junction. Like the previous two washed out sections, the steep canyon walls and loose rock make it difficult and dangerous to scramble through the chasm.  WTA volunteer Backcountry Response Teams restored a badly washed-out section here in 2010.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll traverse more lava on the 4.75 miles to the Ape Canyon Trail.  Some of the best wild flowers are at the top of the canyon north of Pumice Butte. You finally have 4 miles of relatively smooth trail across the Plains of Abraham, then up Windy Pass and back to the intersection of the Windy Trail (#216). From there you&#x2019;re on familiar terrain following the Truman Trail (#207) back to Windy Ridge.<br><br>NOTE:  Trip mileage does not include required approach trails to the loop.  Some guide books give total vertical around 4000 ft, but with Blue Lake Wash detour and careful measurement, all the ups and downs make it more like 6000+ feet including whatever approach you choose.</p>\n                 ",

Camp Wooten is a popular recreation camp used by local 4-H and other youth groups.<br><br>Humans, of course, fish here, but so do kingfishers, bald eagles, falcons, raccoons, black bears, and river otters.

This path weaves in and out of side canyons and up and down small rises and ridges, always working upstream, but seldom coming very close to the waters of Quartz Creek. When it does dip down and access the creek, however, the views are stunning. <br><br>The creek is a rugged, swift mountain river teeming with trout. Several good campsites are easily accessible, many of them near the shores of the creek, and the scenery near and away from the river is spectacular. The side canyons and ravines are often cut down the middle by rushing tributary creeks that thunder through narrow slots and bound over steep drops. The forest that shades the entire route is dominated by deep, old groves of Douglas-fir and western red cedar, and the high, shimmering cliff walls of Quartz Canyon are beautiful. <br><br>The trail rolls up and down as it meanders up the Quartz Creek valley for several miles. The first mile actually makes use of an ancient miner&apos;s road, though nature has reclaimed most of the old roadbed, leaving just a single track to follow.  You might still find a few rusty hulks along the path, though-the last dingy remains of miners&apos; broken dreams. <br><br>The trail crosses Platinum Creek at about 0.75 mile. No bridge exists, so you&apos;ll need to ford the creek. This is generally easily accomplished unless the creek is swollen with snowmelt early in the year. As with all river crossings, use extreme caution.<br><br>At 2 miles, the trail brings you to the second river crossing, though this time there is (usually) a stable footlog to bridge Straight Creek. The forest adjoining Straight Creek is mostly old second-growth, but it&apos;s grown up nicely. Just across the creek, you&apos;ll find the first of the fine campsites that dot this route. <br><br>Push on another 2 miles, passing yet another old (1970s-era) clear-cut full of young trees and then more ancient forest. You&apos;ll find the third creek crossing, at Snagtooth Creek, 4 miles out. There are campsites here for those who want them, and for day hikers, Snagtooth makes a wonderful place to stop and rest before turning back.\n                 ",

Do it as a long hike, a simple overnight backpacking trip, or set up a base camp at one of the fine campsites along the way and enjoy a few days exploring the flank of the big volcano. <br>The trail begins high on a ridge covered with old-growth pine and climbs steeply to the rock and ice of the alpine world. Along the way, it offers views of rushing rivers and hanging glaciers, cool forests and sun-filled flower meadows, fields of berries and herds of deer and elk. <br><br><br>The trail leaves the clear-cuts near the road&apos;s end and climbs to the wilderness boundary in the first quarter mile. From there, the path rides the sharp spine of Stagman Ridge. The ridge crest is shaded by ancient pine forests, but the sheer drop to the south is apparent, even in the cool shadows of the forest. The ridge slopes gently away to the north, but its southern face drops almost vertically more than 1000 feet to the bottom of the Cascade Creek valley.<br><br>This precipitous ridge walk continues for just about 1.5 miles before the trail angles north away from the cliff top and into deeper forest. At 2 miles, the way crosses a thundering (in early summer, anyway) creek at 5100 feet and begins a gentle 2-mile climb to Horseshoe Meadow at 5800 feet.<br><br>The Stagman Ridge Trail joins the PCT about 0.5 mile west of Horseshoe Meadow amid splendid views of Mount Adams. From the broad, flower-filled meadows, the White Salmon Glacier, Avalanche Glacier, and the mountain&apos;s true summit are all seen from the clearings here. <br><br>Leaving Horseshoe Meadow (5900 feet), the PCT climbs gradually for another 2 miles through alpine meadow and open stands of timber. At 6100 feet, the trail is at timberline on the western edge of The Bumper-a knob of basalt at the edge of the trees. <br><br>It&apos;s possible to scramble to the top of the 6490-foot rock, but be warned that the lava rock is sharp and brittle. Hands, clothing, and even boot leather are all at risk. The jagged rock will slice and dice faster than any machine sold by Ron Popeil.<br><br>View The Bumper and its adjacent lava fields at the foot of Mount Adams before heading back down the trail. Backpackers will find fine campsites throughout the Horseshoe Meadow area. Water can be found in the small streams and seeps scattered around the meadows.\n                 ",

These rocks are dusted with an ash pumice than tends to shred the skin. You&#x2019;d be wise to bring garden gloves for this section! It can also be windy, so bring layers and a jacket as well.<br><br>The last section of trail climbs about 1000 vertical feet through ash and small rocks to the crater rim. It&#x2019;s described by many as &#x201C;two steps forward and one step back.&#x201D; Gaiters and long pants are a good choice here. And to get your mind off of the slow slog, be sure to take in the views! You are going upward and before you know it you will be standing on the summit.<br><br>The scene at the top is almost surreal &#x2013; the huge crater with a dome growing rapidly in size each year and the state&#x2019;s newest glacier forming a horseshoe around it. And the incredible views to Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount Rainier floating above the blue-green undulating hills surrounding them. Be sure to stay well-back from the rim while taking photos; this is a cornice and could easily break under your feet.<br><br>After enjoying the top, it is time to head down.

Permits can run out, so be sure to purchase yours well in advance of your trip.

This is the Lemei Lake Trail (No. 179). Here, you&apos;ll take the left-hand trail and hike south to Lemei Lake. More like a vast puddle, Lemei Lake is a shallow, somewhat dirty lake. <br><br>Continuing south through the broken forest (stands of pine and fir intermingled with open meadows and clearings), you&apos;ll find Junction Lake at 5 miles from the trailhead. Junction Lake, so named because two side-trails merge into the Pacific Crest Trail at the lakeshore, is a muddy, frog-filled pond at the base of East Crater. Junction Lake is shallow and therefore warm, proving the perfect place to breed a healthy population of mosquitoes, so move on by quickly.<br><br>From Junction Lake, continue south on the PCT, following it around the west flank of the East Crater, before starting a long, gentle descent to Blue Lake, about 1.5 miles from the junction.

This route explores the sparse pine forests flanking the edge of that massive ancient river of molten rock that is the Aiken Lava Bed. Though the magma no longer flows, hike here in August and you&apos;ll get a sense of the heat that must have been thrown off by the molten flow-the hot August sun bakes that black basalt rock until the ambient air around the lava bed can easily climb 10 to 20 degrees hotter than that of the surrounding forestlands.

From this point on, the forest becomes far more sparse, and meadows and forest clearings become common occurrences.

These placid lakes are accessible via two different trails: a moderate 4.5 mile hike from the west, or a more strenuous 8-mile approach from the east. Either way, the lake will be a peaceful refuge once you arrive. <br><br>The approach from the west begins with a walk through a flat wooded meadow. Shortly after winding through this area, the trail begins climbing steeply 700 feet to a ridgeline. Catch your breath here and gaze at Mount Hood, Indian Heaven, and your destination, all visible from the ridgeline. <br><br>As so many hikes to lake basins do, the trail begins descending roughly a quarter-mile after gaining the ridgeline. You&apos;ll lose nearly all the elevation you just gained as you descend to the lake. It&apos;s just 2.2 miles to the lake from the western approach, with about 1270 feet of elevation gain. <br><br>The approach from the eastern trailhead at Government Mineral Springs trailhead is a longer, tougher hike. Start out on the other side of the gate, walking down a dirt road. You&apos;ll pass about six cabin rental sites, then turn and enter the Trapper Creek Wilderness on your right. Shortly after, the trail hits a rocky streambed, which you&apos;ll follow for a few hundred yards; you&apos;ll have to clamber up a rockfall section to complete this successfully.<br><br>Continue onward and you&apos;ll soon run smack into substantial treefall. Buried among these giants are the remnants of what may have once been an old bridge across the river. Do not go that way; it is brushy and marshy and very unstable. Instead look just to your left and you&apos;ll see a faint, overgrown  trail paralleling Trapper Creek. Follow this until the trail deadends agains the creek. Look carefully and you&apos;ll see that you can cross over the creek here with a network of roots and trees, or you can bypass around to the left. This is easier than it sounds.<br><br>Once around this obstacle, the trail becomes clearer (note the log bridge to your right, you&apos;ll reference it later). Follow the trail as it curves away from the river, climbs a little, crosses the creek one more time, and then climbs very quickly to a signed junction, about three-quarters of a mile from the trailhead. Continue straight ahead and up through this junction.<br><br>Now the trail heads straight up - maybe 1000 feet per mile for about two miles. Though you&apos;ll be hiking on mostly good tread, there may be trees down across the trail. This east-facing slope is moderately shaded and is more exposed in the mornings than in the afternoons. There are beautiful old-growth trees here, a good view of Mount Hood, and peek-a-boo views of Mount Adams and the Goat Rocks as you crest the ridge.<br><br>Eventually you&apos;ll hear but not see a waterfall from the trail (a side trail takes you to some views of this). From there it&apos;s just a short distance before you crest out in Soda Peaks Lake basin.<br><br>The lake is subalpine, still with snow on its western shores in early summer. It is a lovely little lake, very quiet, with fish, clear water, and several nice campsites around the shores. The views to Mount Adams and the Goat Rocks remain mostly obscured by trees, but the lake itself is the treat.<br><br>Note that the bridge over Trapper Creek is washed out, making for a difficult ford during hiking season, especially early season.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: Overnighters, take note of where you drop your pack. While camping sites are available around Soda Peaks Lake, some areas have been designated as day use areas. Please be sure to keep these areas clear for day hikers to enjoy the destination.</p>\n                 ",

    "desc": "\n                    <p>The Big Lava Bed is the home of an old lava flow-magma oozed out of fis-sures and cracks in the heart of the Lava Bed (as well as along the lower flanks of Mount Adams, in the southern Indian Heaven area, and of course, around Mount St. Helens). The flows began some 9000 years ago and, as Mount St. Helens showed, volcanic activity in the area is still occurring. The Big Lava Bed is a volcanic formation, but it&apos;s not the classic conical volcano. Rather, it is a 20-square-mile flow of basalt that flowed out of a source vent found in the north-central part of the bed, just south of Goose Lake.<br><br>Spindly pines cover much of the Big Lava Bed, giving it the appearance of a gentle, young forest from a distance. Get near the lava, though, and the truth comes out: There is nothing gentle about this landscape. <br><br>The PCT skirts the west side of the basalt field, and almost immediately after starting the hike, the harsh nature of the lava bed is nakedly evident. Step off the trail, and the landscape is nearly impassable. The lava is abrasive, brittle, and very unstable. Try to scramble to the top of one of the short lava knobs scattered around the area, and you&apos;ll find your leather boots not just scuffed but slashed and cut to ribbons. Better to enjoy the rugged beauty of the lava flow from the relative safety of the trail.<br><br>The trail leaves the horse camp and within the first 0.25 mile meets the lava flows. The trail then rolls with the flow, as it were, skirting the rough lava on its western flank. To the west of the trail is an open pine forest scarred with clear-cuts, but the buffer of trees along the trail block most of that logging damage from view. Besides, the lava beds will keep your eyes turned away from the other side of the trail.<br><br>The terrain in the Big Lava Bed is a jumble of rock. Huge blocks of lava, towering up like black cotton-candy tufts, dot the landscape. Many of these are pahoehoe formations-wrinkled masses of rock formed by fast-moving lava. Pahoehoe is easy to identify: just look for the rocks that remind you of shar-pei dogs, a solid mass of ropey folds and wrinkles. Between the great tufts of lava are fissures, crevices, pressure ridges, and fields of sharp, jagged black basalt. <br><br>The trail follows alongside this world of volcanic turmoil for nearly 3 miles before edging away from the lava into a calmer world of pine forests. The trail rolls gently through the forest for another 3.5 miles to the southeast flank of Big Huckleberry Mountain. <br><br>For a full day of hiking, turn around where the trail leaves the lava for a short outing over to Big Huckleberry Mountain. Take note that the mountain is aptly named-in late summer the area around the mountain is flush with marble-sized purple fruit. There is no path to the mountain&apos;s forested top, so stick to the sun-dappled clearings along the trail.</p>\n                 ",

The woods are teeming with wildlife, but remarkably lacking in human visitors, making it a wonderful place in which to find solitude and an opportunity to see a variety of birds and animals. During a visit in late September, I counted no less than a dozen species of birds, including downy woodpeckers, ravens, siskins, a mountain bluebird, an oriole, and a Cooper&apos;s hawk.

    "desc": "\n                    <p>Moulton Falls Trail is an out-and-back hike along the Lewis River. The trail crosses a picturesque footbridge and then follows the Lewis River with the river to the right and a mossy cliff to the left. The wide hard-surfaced trail is mostly flat, making this a perfect year round hike for people of all ages. <br><br>This hike combines a peaceful stroll with a bit of adventure. After a short steep pitch down from the parking lot, the virtually flat trail allows you to cruise down the spacious path as fast or a slow as you like. For a side adventure, you can check out Big Tree Falls or climb the Bells Mountain Trail to a viewpoint.<br><br>The drive to the trailhead follows part of the Clark County Scenic Drive and is worth the trip alone. The road follows a particularly beautiful stretch of the Lewis River as it flows over volcanic rock formations. The smooth rocks and small pools make this a favorite summertime place for locals to swim and sun. The road also passes the not-to-be-missed Lucia Falls. It is definitely worth stopping and taking the short walk to view one of the region&#x2019;s most scenic water features. <br><br>The hike starts at the Moulton Falls overflow parking lot near the junction of Lucia Falls Road with Sunset Falls Road. There are multiple paths in this area, so make sure to snap a photo of the map at the trailhead if you don&#x2019;t have a map with you.  <br><br>From the parking lot, turn left at the trailhead sign and go down the slope towards the river. Partway down the hill, you will come to a junction with a path leading off to the right. You will go left for this hike, but this is a good place to take a side trip to the right and go see Moulton falls. <br><br>After you return to the trail, continue downhill to the arch bridge with its spectacular views of the Lewis River far below. On one side, the river flows through a narrow tree-lined canyon, and on the other side the river opens up to peacefully flow towards the falls. This is the best spot on the hike to take postcard-perfect pictures, so be sure to stop, enjoy the view, and take some photos. <br><br>Just after the crossing the bridge, you will come to two junctions to the right leading to picnic areas. Keep left and stay on the wide path that follows an old road grade along the river through a mixed forest of big leaf maples, alders, cedars and Douglas firs. Although there is a road across the river, it is mostly hidden from view with the river masking the road sounds. <br><br>A half mile from the trailhead, you will come to the Bells Mountain Trail. If you are feeling energetic, you may want to take a side excursion to a viewpoint 1.5 miles up the trail. This rigorous 1,000-foot climb will certainly earn you bragging rights if you decide to tackle it. <br><br>Our hike, however, continues on the main trail along the river. In about a mile, the path leaves the river to follow the Chelatche Prairie Railroad to a small lake with a picnic area on the far end. This is a pleasant spot for a snack or picnic and is the turnaround point for this hike. If you would like a longer hike or need toilet facilities, you can go a half mile further to the Hantwick Road trailhead. After you turn around, retrace your steps back to your car.<br><br>Before you leave, be sure to cross Lucia Falls Road and follow the trail to Big Tree Falls. These impressive Niagra-like falls are the best of the three in the park. When the steel bridge just below the falls is open, you can get striking views of the water as it churns through a narrow chasm beneath you. If the bridge is open, you can turn your trek into a 1.7 mile loop. Otherwise, turn around and return to your car.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: After the hike, consider stopping at one of the local wineries, soaking your feet in one of the pools along the river, or stopping at Rocky&#x2019;s Pizza in Battle Ground for food in an eclectic old-west setting.</p>\n                 ",

Avoid this route when wet or icy.<br><br>From the junction, continue uphill on the Silver Star Trail for another 1/4 mile and head left up a rocky road bed - the Silver Star Summit Trail (#180D). On a clear day, the views from the summit are sublime - Mounts Hood, Rainier and St. Helens, as well as the forested hills of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and the Yacolt Burn State Forest. <br><br>On the return you can retrace your route or stay on the west side of the ridge on the Silver Star Trail (#180) to get back to the trailhead. You can also keep hiking from here. Several trails meet near the Silver Star summit. Hikers can follow the Chinook Trail to the Kloochman Butte Trail (#180B) to the west or the Bluff Mountain Trail (#172) to the east.</p>\n                 ",

Drive through the first large parking lot and park in the second large lot.

Wildlife abounds here, even in winter, and the boardwalk and raised trail that carries you through Silver Lake puts you up close and personal with the flora and fauna supported by this huge lake&#x2013;-one of the largest ecosystems of its kind in the western United States. Kids will love this easy hike, and, when open, the visitors center makes an excellent supplement to your outside explorations.<br><br>If the mile-long loop wasn&#x2019;t quite enough for your venturesome self, take the tunnel under the road and the trail up into the camping and day-use area. There is a maze of trails here, offering everything from a quarter-mile loop around the campgrounds to a mile-long perimeter hike of the forest to the north of the campgrounds and yurts. <br><br>The trails here are easy enough to follow, if somewhat poorly signed, so be sure you have a map of your own, or plenty of time for doubling back. Towards the far reaches of the trail system, the trails cross several small creeks and incorporate stairs and short, steep climbs, making for a more rugged experience.<br> <br>WTA Pro Tip: If some of your party is keen to explore the trails but others don&#x2019;t want to make the trek, a playground at the center of the campground makes a great meeting spot.</p>\n                 ",

This hike loops through colossal Douglas fir trees and waist-high sword ferns to provide a primordial experience where you are dwarfed by nature. There is a small meadow for a picnic and the remnants of a grist mill to explore. This hike is a great way to escape urban life and be immersed in a peaceful forest environment.<br><br>Whipple Creek Park has over four miles of mixed-use trails. This hike combines the South Ridge and Grist Mill Loops to provide variety and capture the highlights of the park. The park is heavily forested with a labyrinth of trails, both marked and unmarked. To avoid getting turned around, download a copy of the park map from the Vancouver Clark Parks &amp; Recreation website and take a copy of this guide with you. <br><br>The trailhead is on NW 31st Avenue. Park at the paved area near a raspberry field, and then walk down the road 200 yards to the trailhead marker and a white gate.

Shortly after reaching the top, you will be rewarded by a pretty little meadow with a picnic table. After enjoying the meadow, follow the trail to reenter the woods. You will soon come to a junction with the trail on the left heading uphill. Take the trail to the right and start downhill. The woods open up here, providing nice views to the right. <br><br>When you come to the next junction, go to the right and in 30 yards go to the right again to connect with the Grist Mill Loop. Follow the trail downhill to Whipple Creek. When you get to the bottom of the hill, go left and cross the creek. The stone remains of the grist mill will be on your left.<br><br>After checking out the grist mill, start uphill. When you come to an unmarked trail off to the right, stay left and continue on the main trail. The trail passes through woods with alder trees, and then turns to the left to parallel a barbed wire fence with farmland to the right. <br><br>You will come to a junction in about 60 yards after reentering the woods. Go to the left. At the next junction, go right and in about 20 yards go right again to rejoin the South Ridge Loop.    <br><br>Go uphill until you come to a junction.

Turn right, cross the bridge, and turn left at the trail junction. Go up a short heart-thumping hill. When you get to the junction at the top, go left to return to your car. <br><br>NOTE: This is a deep-woods experience where the trails can be muddy.

Dalles Mountain Ranch can be explored by vehicle or on foot, but getting out and hiking gives you the chance to take in up close what the rolling hills of the eastern Columbia River Gorge are all about. <br><br>Wind your way up the long dirt road under the watchful eyes of grazing cattle. A variety of area wildlife--coyotes, deer, yellow-bellied marmots, various birds of prey--can be observed frolicking in the fields or soaring overhead. At a fork in the road, take the left branch and explore an assortment of old farm machinery, rusting away in the fields. Continue on, passing two dilapidated farmhouses, which appear ready to collapse with the next blast of Gorge wind. Above, a small parking area provides access for the area beyond: Columbia Hills Natural Area Preserve. There are no official trails, so hike the roadway within the preserve. Dogs are not permitted in this area. <br><br>Add to your day in the eastern Gorge by taking a guided walk to the mysterious pictograph, She-Who-Watches, or visit the nearby Horsethief Butte. A little farther east, find Maryhill Museum and Maryhill Winery, perfect for a picnic lunch or wandering amid the sculpture garden. And since you;re there, you need to check out the life-size re-creation of Stonehenge, sitting atop a bluff overlooking the Columbia River.</p>\n                 ",

You get to go up, over and around mogul-like mounds peppered with volcanic rock, explore the upper rim of Coyote Wall, and descend a grassy slope with uninterrupted views of the Colombia River Gorge. In the spring there is a steady progression of wildflowers, making this an especially good early-season hike.<br><br>This loop hike begins with Coyote Wall towering above you as you walk down an abandoned highway. Coyote Wall is a 200-foot cliff of columnar basalt that was formed as the ancient Missoula floods swept through the Columbia River Basin. The uphill portion of this hike is on the Little Moab trail (CO3).  On the first half of the Little Moab you get to climb through an area of grass-covered hills, exposed bedrock, lichen-covered volcanic rocks, and the occasional ponderosa pine. The second half parallels the rim of Coyote Wall, giving you close-up views of basalt cliffs with multiple opportunities to peer down from the top. <br><br>The downhill portion of this hike is on the Little Maui (CO5) trail, which meanders down a grassy slope dotted with white oaks and then descends along a stream with several waterfalls. The Little Maui trail provides postcard-perfect views of the hills above Labyrinth Creek to the east and the Colombia River to the south. The hike ends with a short walk on the old highway back to the trailhead.  <br><br>Begin this hike by parking at the Coyote Wall Trailhead and heading east on the old Highway 8. Just after a turquoise gate, you will come to an old cattle chute on the left. Continue east while enjoying the striking views of Coyote Wall.<br><br>After 0.6 miles, you will come to a well-marked trailhead on the left side of the road. Take the trail uphill; keeping in mind that you need to go left at each junction. Shortly after starting uphill, you will come to a trail junction. Keep to the left and continue uphill. After going over two areas of exposed bedrock, you will come to a second trail junction. Again, go to the left and continue uphill 0.3 miles until you come to the Little Moab Trail (CO3). There are some particularly nice views of the Colombia River through this section, so have your camera ready.<br><br>When you come to the junction with the Little Moab trail, go to the left and follow the trail towards the top of Coyote Wall. This part of the hike may bring out your inner child as you wind through grassy mounds, climb up exposed bedrock, and skirt rocky outcroppings. In 0.3 miles, you will come to your first view of Coyote Wall from the top and another trail junction. <br><br>Stay left and follow the Little Moab Trail along the upper edge of Coyote Wall where you will have multiple opportunities to view the rocky cliffs that make the wall. After 0.4 miles, the trail breaks out into an open grassy area and comes to the intersection with an old jeep road (CO4) just downhill from a photo-ready barbwire fence. You will turn left on the old jeep road for this hike, but first it is well worth going through the gap in the fence and taking the trail on the left to a viewpoint at the top of wall. With views of the Coyote Wall, Mt. Hood, and the Colombia River Gorge, this makes a good spot for a break.<br><br>After enjoying the view, go back through the fence and follow the old jeep road east 0.2 miles to the Little Maui trail (CO3). At this junction, the jeep road takes a sharp turn to the right while the Little Maui trail takes off to the left. Go left and begin your descent down the Little Maui trail. The first part of the trail follows a serpentine path through grassy plateaus dotted with solitary white oaks. You can see the hills and rocky outcroppings above Labyrinth Creek to the east, the Colombia River to the South, and wildflower during the spring. The second part of the trail takes you along a stream with small cascading waterfalls. <br><br>In 0.9 miles, you will come to a junction with a trail going to the left. Keep going straight to stay on the Little Maui Trail. After another 0.1 miles the Little Maui trail joins the old jeep road. Turn left and follow the road downhill.  Near the bottom you will encounter a maze of trails with several options for returning to the old highway.  Keep on an established trail and watch out for mountain bikers. After reaching the old highway, turn right to return to your car. <br><br>CAUTION: <br>You may encounter poison oak on this hike.

Turning east, head through more forest, then emerge onto the top edge of the Coyote Wall, into huge meadows, dotted with rocky volcanic outcrops and an abundance of wildflowers.<br><br>The trailhead begins just past a gated road, at the corner of Hwy 14 and Courtney Rd. A couple hundred yards up the road, at an abandoned cattle chute, hang a left (your only left turn of the loop) and start the trail clockwise. The trail gradually heads upwards, through stands of oak and ponderosa pine, with small meadows displaying buttercup, candyflower, and a variety of other small colors. As the tree cover begins to thicken, pass a faint trail that branches off to the right; this leads up a steep path to a notch in the wall (this could make for a shorter loop). Arriving at a main T-junction, take the right trail, and continue on a gradually fading trail until you come to a gate on an old forest lane. Just past the gate is Courtney Rd; turn right and start up the road. You&#x2019;ll pass a secluded house on the left, round a couple more bends, then arrive at the westernmost bend in the road, and the scene opens for a spectacular look down on the Columbia River, Hood River on the Oregon side, and distant Mt. Hood.<br><br>Continuing up Courtney Rd, pass a beautiful house on the left with grand views, then bear right on Atwood Rd, which ends shortly and turns back into trail. Now on top of the Coyote Wall, heading east through pine forest, keep your eyes open for fairy slipper and blue buttons. There are several &#x201C;No Trespassing&#x201D; signs in the area, so stick to the trail. When you arrive at a junction with left and right options, continue straight ahead (the trail to the right descends to the lower section of the loop passed earlier). Soon the trail turns to the right, mounts a small, grassy rise, and deposits hikers at the edge of Coyote Wall, with more spectacular views and wide-open meadows filled with balsamroot, lupine and cluster lily. Drop your pack to stop and savor the scene.<br><br>Once you&#x2019;ve had your fill and are ready to pick up again, the trail &#x2013; now trails, as this area is known as &#x201C;the labyrinth&#x201D; &#x2013; continues east. Choose to hike along the edge of the wall, or straight down through meadow - the trails will merge again farther down. Pass through an opening in a wood and barbed wire gate, and again choose your path, descending through a big, meadowed slope. Several other trails snake back and forth across this hillside. Ignore those and continue straight down. At another fenced opening at a T-junction, bear right to keep descending along the edge of the wall, or turn left and descend through a tree-shaded creek swale (this will deposit you a little farther east at the end). The trail continues to descend back toward the road, along the edge of Coyote Wall, with opportunities to view the length of the wall as you wander down through rock-strewn meadows. When the trail ends at a now-closed section of old highway, turn right and head back to your starting point.<br><br>Notes: This trail is popular with mountain bikers, and though hikers technically have the right-of-way, be cautious and courteous. This area is home to ticks and poison oak; take the appropriate precautions.  Rattlesnakes have been seen in summer months&#x2014;be aware.</p>\n                 ",

On a good day, you can get a bird&#x2019;s eye view of Mt. Hood and the Columbia River. In the spring the top is carpeted with vibrant yellow balsam root. Although the trail is steep and sometimes crowded, this hike is unquestionably worth the effort.<br><br>The hike begins with a heart-thumping one-half mile climb through a wooded area to a junction. Turn right and continue your uphill trek. Soon you will be treated to glimpses of the Columbia River through the foliage. During the spring, you may also come face-to-face with wildflowers on the hillside next to the trail. <br><br>One mile past the junction, the trail comes to a viewpoint where you get a panoramic view of the Columbia River, Wind Mountain, and the top of Dog Mountain. This makes a good picnic spot and turnaround point for a shorter hike. <br><br>After enjoying the viewpoint, resume your uphill ascent for a half-mile to the second trail junction. Bear right and head up another half-mile to the site of a former fire lookout. The lookout was built in 1931 to watch for fires across the river in the Mount Hood National Forest. The wide openness makes this an excellent spot to pause and take in the scenery.<br><br>From the lookout, it is only a half mile to the top of the meadow. This portion of the hike is out in the open and very picturesque. However, you&#x2019;ll need to turn your focus from the scenery to your feet as you skirt the top of a cliff. It can also be quite breezy, so be prepared for gusty winds.<br><br>Getting to the top is a cause for celebration, and you may be greeted by a swarm of people buzzing with excitement after having made the rigorous climb. This is not a spot for quiet introspection. Instead, join the party-like atmosphere and savor the view. <br><br>Retrace your steps to return to the car. You can also make this a loop hike by coming back down the Augspurger Mountain Trail. This adds 0.9 miles to the hike, but is more knee-friendly and provides additional views of the Columbia River.  A tenth of a mile down from the top of the meadow, take the trail to the right. Continue for 1.1 miles to a junction. Turn left and follow the trail 2.7 miles back to your car. <br><br>WTA Pro-Tip: The perfect way to end your Dog Mountain experience is to stop in Stevenson Washington at the Walking Man Brewery or the Big River Grill. The Walking Man Brewery serves a wide variety of their own brews along with sandwiches and gourmet pizzas, and the outdoor seating area allows you to continue your commune with nature. <br><br>If you&#x2019;d like a more upscale dining experience, try the Big River Grill which features Northwest Cuisine using fresh local ingredients. With its license plate collection and Columbia River sturgeon mermaid, the food is Portland-good and the atmosphere roadhouse quirky.</p>\n                 ",

Lewis and Clark camped here on their way to the Pacific, and it was at Beacon Rock that they first noticed the tides affecting water levels in the Columbia River, more than 120 miles from the mouth. It was this team of explorers that gave the rock its modern name, though they were initially undecided on whether it should be &quot;Beacon Rock&quot; or &quot;Beaten Rock.&quot;<br><br>Its sheer walls were unscaled until 1901, and the modern trail to the top follows that original route. Climbers are still able to scale the rock today, but only on the northwest face. The rest of the rock is closed to climbing, to protect nesting falcons. <br><br>From a developed parking area on the south side of the highway, the hike heads up immediately -- after all, you have 848 feet to climb in less than a mile. But the grade is surprisingly gentle, with plenty of places to catch your breath and enjoy a view. Moss covered boulders line the wide gravelled path at the base. The trail then curves around to the south side of the rock, where you encounter handrails and a sturdy boardwalk trail that switchbacs all the way to the top of the mountain. <br><br>Along the way, the trail winds in and out of trees -- surprisingly huge for growing out of a rock mountainside. You&apos;ll enjoy views up- and down-river of the mighty Columbia, and far below is a boat launch and the day use area of Beacon Rock State Park. Even on foggy days, the views are interesting and the fog can add to the mystique of the trail. <br><br>There is also a small lake visible in the meadows at western edge of the rock. This is Riddell Lake, accessible via a wide trailhead at the picnic area at the base of Beacon Rock. It&apos;s a nice option for folks who might not want to venture up to the summit, since it offers an interesting southern view of the monolith but beware of bugs! Roundtrip to the lake is less than half a mile. <br><br>The summit of Beacon Rock features a sign offering you a congratulations on summitting, as well as an expansive view upriver towards Bonneville Dam.

It&#x2019;s a long journey at about 7.5 miles, and steep in places, but nothing a healthy dog, child or senior citizen can&#x2019;t do. You&#x2019;ll meet all of these smiling folks on this hike during the peak seasons.<br><br>Located in the Columbia River Gorge Natural Scenic Area within Beacon Rock State Park, Hamilton Mountain can be tackled one of two ways. Try hiking it straight up and down for a six-mile roundtrip, or take the loop for a 7.5 mile round trip. Either way, it&#x2019;s a great trek.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a steady easy pace for the first mile up the wide, well-built trail.  In addition to avid hikers from Portland, Vancouver and elsewhere, you&#x2019;ll encounter incredible old-growth Douglas fir along this stretch. Wildflowers love this mountain, and you might want to check the trail sides for tasty wild strawberries in the late spring. <br> <br>At one mile in, you&#x2019;ll likely hear the waterfalls before you see a trail heading down to the Hardy Falls viewpoint. This is a steep little pitch, and the views are mostly obscured by trees, so if you&#x2019;re into the big cascading falls, keep on going until you see a side trail leading up to Rodney Falls and Pool of the Winds.  <br><br>The upper falls is protected by a rail, but you can get close enough to feel the spray. From here you&#x2019;ll see the lower falls, so head back down to the main trail and catch the falls from below for some great views and photo ops. The rigid Columbia basalt rock makes its presence known at the falls, as these carved rocks stood the test of time through catastrophic floods and landslides that scoured the gorge for the past 15 million years. <br> <br>The trail gets a little steeper past the falls, but there are some rugged stairs that help out.  At 1.3 miles in, the trail intersects Hardy Creek Trail where the sign declares &#x201C;Hamilton Mountain - More Difficult&#x201D; and &#x201C;Hardy Creek Trail - Difficult&#x201D;.  Take the &#x201C;More Difficult&#x201D; route and continue counter-clockwise up the Hamilton Mountain Trail, switchbacking up for a 1400 foot climb to the top. You can take the Hardy Creek Trail for a 3.2 mile route clockwise to the top to complete the loop, but the better route is to take the Hamilton Mountain Trail up. Plus, it&#x2019;s easier on the knees coming down the Hardy Creek Trail.   <br> <br>When you reach the top of Hamilton Mountain three miles up, you&#x2019;ll be rewarded with panoramic views of the photo-worthy Cascade peaks, but it you continue another .75 mile northwest on the narrower loop trail, a prominent ridge will provide even better views! Wildflowers are in abundance up here.  Most people descend the same way they came up, but for an extra 1.5 net gain in mileage, you&#x2019;ll explore the west side cool lush forest and likely will have it all to yourself.  <br><br>The northernmost part of the trail is four miles in, where a well-marked sign points the way to the Hardy Creek Trail, shared with equestrians. From here, you&#x2019;ll descend along an old road bed part of the way.

Take the left trail (southeast towards the Hamilton Mountain Trail) and continue on this hardy trail that boasts tremendous log retaining walls and bridges along the slick hillsides.

There are alternative hikes in the area, and the trail to the twin cascades of Hardy and Rodney Falls is hands down the best option.<br><br>From the lower trailhead, start off hiking on a wide path through tall trees and mosses, accompanied by twittering, flitting songbirds. Most of the elevation gain is in the first mile, until you come to a junction with another trail. This one comes in from the campground at the end of the road you drove in on. This route adds about .20 miles to your hike, a good option for anyone wanting the views of the falls with less of the elevation gain. <br><br>After the junction, the trail flattens out and traverses through more forest, passing small creeks and cascades that provide excellent photography opportunities. At about a mile and a half, hikers will hear Hardy and Rodney Falls, but two bridge crossings over smaller cascades come first. Take time to see how high up these little waterfalls go -- you will be surprised and impressed. <br><br>Rounding the corner, you&apos;ll encounter a junction heading down to an overlook of Hardy Falls. There are two viewing platforms, both offering gorgeous views of the mighty falls. Be careful on the trail on the way down -- when it is wet, the mud can be slippery. These are likely picnic areas, if you don&apos;t mind sitting down on the platform, though there is one small bench available as well. <br><br>After soaking in the view of Hardy Falls, head back up to the original trail. Cross a bridge built by DNR work crews, and continue just a few yards up the trail to Rodney Falls. Here the trail splits. Head down and to the right to continue across a wide bridge at the base of thundering Rodney Falls. This is the Hamilton Mountain trail, and heads up to a loop around the summit crown of the mountain. <br><br>If you don&apos;t have the time, energy, or desire to continue, the trail up and to the left brings you to the Pool of Winds in just a few hundred feet. This spur trail ends on the rock just adjacent to the first tier of Rodney Falls, where hikers can bask in the spray from the falls and peer into the splash pool, all behind the safety of a handrail. <br><br>In particularly high water, it may be impossible to get all the way to the Pool of Winds viewpoint, but usually this is a great diversion for hikers of all ages, and provides and excellent reward and rest stop before turning around and heading back down the trail.<br><br>WTA Pro Tip: A CCC-built shelter is available on a first-come, first-serve basis with four outlets, overhead light, two wood stoves, and three picnic tables; perfect for a birthday party or reunion!</p>\n                 ",

The park has over six miles of trails, with both wide-hard surfaced paths and more primitive dirt tracks. This loop hike combines both types to give you the optimum experience while exploring a lake, creek, and two waterfalls. There is also an optional side trip to visit the Lily Fields, which are infused with purple camas blossoms from mid-April to mid-May. Although there are some heart-thumping uphill sections, the hike is generally easy and appropriate for reasonably fit people of all ages. <br><br>There is a labyrinth of trails in the park, and it&#x2019;s easy to end up someplace you didn&#x2019;t intend to go. Be sure to print a copy of these instructions and download a map or snap a photo of one at the trailhead. Keep in mind, though, that many of the trails do not show on the map.<br><br>The hike begins at the southern end of the Round Lake picnic area. In about 0.3 miles, you will come to a screening device and a dam. The screening device was built to keep fish and debris out of the water supply for the paper mill, and the dam serves as Lacamas Creek&#x2019;s outlet from the lake. Cross the screening device and then the dam, ignoring side trails to the right until after you cross the dam. <br><br>After the dam, skip the primitive trail to the right and continue on to the second trail to the right. This 0.6 mile unmarked trail will take you to the Pothole Falls Overlook and then on to Lower Falls. When the water is low in the summer, Pothole Falls has some interesting geological features. You can see a pair of round pools and weirdly pockmarked bedrock. Floodwaters created the curving, smooth shapes by swirling rocks in depressions in the soft rock. <br><br>After checking out Pothole Falls, return to the trail and continue downstream to Lower Falls. The trail follows the creek from the top of a ravine before dipping into a lightly forested area with small streams. The trail then rejoins Lacamas Creek where you are treated with the sights and sounds water cascading over rocks. Ignore side trails and keep on this trail until you come to a picturesque wooden bridge crossing the creek at the top of Lower Falls. <br><br>Although this hike doesn&#x2019;t include the bridge, it is worth taking some time to explore here. Cross the bridge to take in the falls from the top and perhaps stop at the picnic area on the west side of the creek for a snack. You may also want to take a side-trail downstream on the east side of the creek to experience the full impact of the water tumbling over the falls. <br><br>After exploring the falls, return to the east side of the creek and go uphill on a wide hard-surfaced path. You will soon come to a junction with signs pointing to Round Lake and to an access road. Go towards Round Lake. You will then come to two dirt trails to the left. Skip the first one, and take the second one, which has a small marker indicating it goes to Round Lake. This 0.4 mile shortcut is much more peaceful than continuing on the main path. The trail enters a forest with bracken and sword ferns in the understory and cedar and vine maples overhead. Ignore side trails and stay on the main trail. <br><br>When you come to another hard-surface trail, turn left to return to Round Lake. Along the way, you will see signs for the Camas Lily Fields loop on the right. If you would like explore the loop, turn right at the first sign. The 0.7 mile Lily Fields loop climbs up a hillside, then dips into and out of forested areas and meadows where the camas lilies blossoms are resplendent mid-April to mid-May. <br><br>If you would like to skip the Lily Fields, continue on the hard-surface trail to the second sign for the Camas Lily Fields. Turn right for the scenic shortcut path to the Round Lake Loop Trail. You will come to a junction with the Round Lake Loop trail, which is also where the optional Lily Fields side trip ends. Turn right and follow the hard-surfaced trail 0.7 mile to the trailhead on 35th Avenue. The first section is a hilly up and down trek through the forest, but the second section is a peaceful walk through wetlands near the lake. When you get to 35th, turn left and return to your car.  <br><br>WTA Pro Tip: After your hike, you may want stop at the Lakeside Country Store for a dipped ice cream cone or have a picnic in the park. You may also want to venture into Camas for a treat at Burgerville or a microbrew at the Mill City Brew Works.</p>\n                 ",

The full trail loop provides fantastic views of the Columbia River Gorge, an intimate look at the Cape Horn Falls and a challenging workout as it climbs and descends the rocky slopes of Cape Horn.<br><br>The entire loop is made up of two segments separated by Hwy 14; each are mostly single track, but also include stretches of road where the trail is incomplete.  The description here is a general overview of the loop in a counter-clockwise direction. In some places the route is hard to discern especially where it joins or leaves a road, or where an old segment has been abandoned in favor of a different route. If you have hiked this route before, be a friend and take someone out there who hasn&#x2019;t so they can find the way. Guided hikes are often offered by the Mazamas, Friends of the Columbia River Gorge and the Mt. St. Helens Club.<br><br>The main parking area is the Skamania County Public Transit Park and Ride at the intersection of Salmon Falls Road and Hwy 14. The upper trail begins on the west side of the parking lot, on the opposite side of Salmon Falls Road. From there the trail ascends several steep switchbacks, then traverses west and south past scenic views of Hamilton Mountain, Beacon Rock and the Gorge.<br><br>The hardest part to navigate is where the trail follows a road. this happens twice. First after a short descent from Pioneer Point. And again after crossing Strunk Rd at its dead end where you follow a gravel road south to the Cape Horn summit, former site of a large home that has since been deconstructed. The Friends of the Gorge funded the construction of an overlook platform in honer of their founder, Nancy Russell, who helped to protect the site for the public to enjoy.<br><br>It then descends back to Hwy 14 just west of Cape Horn.<br><br>The lower segment picks up on the opposite side of the Hwy. Crossing the Hwy is much safer now that the Pedestrian underpasses have been built. The lower trail continues to the west passing more cliff top view points before descending mossy talus slopes, then turning eastward. From Feb. 1 until July 15th, the lower segment is closed at a viewpoint just before the decent. This closure is for nesting Peregrine falcons. The trail passes Cape Horn Falls, then traverses a some steep side slopes and rocky outcrops ending at Cape Horn Road. The last 1.3 miles of the route are on Cape Horn Road back to the Park and Ride.<br><br>Be advised that this trail has not yet been constructed to typical Forest Service trail standards so be prepared for steep, rocky terrain, particularly on the lower section.  Some of the viewpoints have precipitous drops that are not recommended for the faint of heart. For a shorter hike try the upper trail going out-and-back from the parking area to the Nancy Russell Overlook.<br><br>Since the trail was only recently made official, it does not appear on Forest Service maps. Follow this link to a map that shows the general location of the trail: www.capehorntrail.org/trailmap.html/. Note also that to minimize disturbance to nesting peregrine falcons, the lower portion of the trail is closed. In 2011 the closure dates were modified to February 1 - July 15.<br><br>Background<br>In the early 1980&apos;s Friends of the Gorge founder Nancy Russell was so inspired by the sweeping vista from atop Cape Horn that she embarked on a 20 year effort to protect the area for all the public to enjoy. Bruce and Nancy Russell purchased land originally slated to become a private subdivision and worked with the Trust for Public Lands to convey the land to the Forest Service.<br><br>Additional parcels were similarly acquired and transferred as the Friends of the Gorge worked in partnership with the Columbia Land Trust, Trust for Public Lands and the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.<br><br>Today the Forest Service owns nearly all the land that the trail is on with the exception of two small sections of trail that are in easements. In addition to gaining a substantial amount of land, the Forest Service also acquired a user-built trail. Prior to sanctioning the already popular trail, the Forest Service completed a lengthy planning process in an effort to balance the trail&apos;s outstanding recreational value with its potential impacts on sensitive species such as peregrine falcons and Larch Mt. salamanders.<br><br>As a result of that plan completed in early 2010, the Cape Horn Trail is scheduled to undergo a number of upgrades to bring it to Forest Service standards for sustainability and safety. As well some sections will be rerouted away from important habitat areas or closed seasonally for nesting falcons.</p>\n                 ",
